       " \"Just about every piece of consumer grade networking equipment you can buy today has its good points, bad points, and bizarre, or cute little quirks. The bad points are usually poor or improper ventilation, the wrong antennas for the job, and misleading descriptions or information. Surprisingly, the DIR-1750-US router only has one significant bad point, and it's in the embedded software (aka firmware). I did what many of us who buy routers do once mine arrived. I went into the router's settings, configured them the way I had in my previous router because that's what I want, and didn't bother reading any of the documentation.\\n\\nThe router itself is very easy to set up, but the software in the router is very, very ignorant. For example, if you manually change the LAN IP and Range to something the router doesn't like, it will tell you that the new addresses were successfully saved. The router will reboot with the new savings enabled; except it won't do it. Once it restarts, if it didn't like those addresses, it didn't save them, and you will see the default LAN IP Address and Range again. There is no error message, or a prompt telling you that you made a mistake. Technically you can assign the majority of LAN IP Addresses as static IP's, leave a smal number of addresses as the DHCP Pool for the router to assign Dynamic IP Addresses, without changing the Network Mask. However, if you make the DHCP Pool of Addresses too small, and do not change the Netmask, the router will simply hang after rebooting.\\n\\nThe hardest thing I had trouble figuring out was why the router not only would stop transmitting a WiFi signal for approximately 30 seconds at a time, after being on for 2 days straight, and why the ethernet ports on the LAN side of the router also suddenly stopped responding randomly after 2 days straight running. What I learned is that the router doesn't like me much, because I make typo's. lol\\n\\nWhen setting up the LAN IP Address and Range for the router, you're not allowed to use anything but the sanctioned and pre-allocated Private IP Address Blocks. As long as the IP Address you choose is within one of the three blocks, the router is fine with it. One block, the most commonly used for home networking devices is 192.168.xxx.xxx, but I accidentally entered 192.169.xxx.xxx, and it worked... until it didn't. For reasons I don't understand, the QoS Settings for the Quality of Service Engine, pretty much broke in my router. I had to repeat the same steps 3 times in a row to get any changes to be saved, but there was no way to verify that they were saved correctly. Once I fixed the typo the QoS settings worked like they should, and so far the problems with the WiFi and ethernet ports have gone away.\\n\\nThe router claims 3 spatial transmit and receive streams simultaneously, which may only seem awesome if your device or WiFi adapter supports AC1750. The thing is that this means the router under good conditions can also communicate with, say 3 old phones, at the same time. Another benefit is the Virtual LAN (VLAN) in the firmware. If you have no other alternative, using a WiFi Guest Zone for IoT (Internet of Things) or SMART Plugs and Switches provides more security than sharing them on the same WiFi network as your personal devices. The problem is if you ever need to manually get into a device's settings, or reset it to bring it back on-line. The WiFi Guest Zone is partitioned off inside many routers, which can become a hassle.\\n\\nBetter yet! Buy yourself a WiFi Access Point, connect it to an ethernet port on the router, and assign that port as a VLAN. In a VLAN, only those devices connected to that port can communicate with each other. Add a switch along with the AP to the VLAN to add more devices. If you need to get into a device, you can simply connect to the AP, or plug a cable into the switch you added to the VLAN. Everything inside the VLAN, just like with the WiFI Guest Zone, is partitioned off from the rest of the devices connected to the router. If the router only supports up to 20 or 30 WiFi clients connected simultaneously, that includes the WiFi Guest Zone. I've easily got over 20 SMART Plugs, Wall Switches, and Dimmers combined. The VLAN gives you something that a WiFi Guest Zone can't: room for expansion.\\n\\nSpeaking about just my DIR-1750-US, because I'm not a network guy, and I have no intentions of getting into networking, the router works best when treated two ways. Plug and Play works best if you just need a router, and want to avoid some of the router's quirks caused by its firmware. The Setup Wizard is quick, simple, and will do most of the work for you. If you want to use some of the more granular features and controls within the settings of the router, then treat the router as a device somewhere between an OpenWRT home router and an Enterprise router. The software seems to have very specific rules in play under certain settings, so things can go sideways. However, all things considered, it's a really good router. It's an ugly router if you're not into gaming, or all things macho, but nothing a well ventilated bag couldn't fix. lol\",\n",

I wanted to get one asap so went to Target and bought the top of the line NetGear router (more than $100 more expensive). This was a disaster. Took over 5 hours with tech support (who were great) to finally get it working. After 2 days it stopped working again. It is simply too complicated. Stick with this one as it is very reliable, relatively easy to set up. The Tech support staff recommended this although I would have bought it anyway. The company continues to modernize this model, now on version 3 and offers very strong support. Highly recommended!',\n",
       " \"I'd pass on this now, though I thought it was a good deal when I bought it. It works pretty well, but you're stuck with old Asus firmware. I love the ASUS full-featured management interface. It doesn't handle 5GHz, with 80MHz bandwidth. Using that setting- the signal comes and goes. But with 40MHz bandwidth, we get very fast downloads and pretty good range. 2.4GHz is fine (but much slower). Glad that MAC filtering works on WiFi (both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency bands). I followed the instructions for updating it to a AC68U, and they worked. Be aware, if you don't have a working router (this was a replacement for one that broke), it will be a pain. I am fortunate to have two PCs, but even a Raspberry PI or two would work, except for the WinSCP part. I think you could probably hack your way around that if you had to.\\n\\nUpdate: I have found that I CANNOT UPDATE THE FIRMWARE. The router sees that new firmware is available, then one of two things happens: If you let the router try to fetch it, it will say that it can't contact ASUS' servers (it already did and still can though), or if you download the driver, unzip it and try to update the firmware from local storage, it gives a message saying the update failed. This causes concern that the WiFi vulnerability disclosed late in 2017 cannot be patched on this equipment.\",\n",
       " 'Purchased one of these to replace another router that died after reading several reviews.\\n\\nCondition - The router arrived in a nice box. The power supply looked brand new with the protective plastic on it. The router itself was in like-new condition with no external blemishes. The antennas came in a bag and looked new as well. It came with an instruction manual and a slip of paper from Amazon about \"certified refurbished.\" Overall, cosmetically it looks like a brand new router.\\n\\nOperation - The router came up with the first time setup out of the box. It had the T-Mobile firmware on it and appeared to be a somewhat recent version as the ssh terminal capability was missing.\\n\\nModding - The router is simple to modify using guides found online to turn it back into an AC68U. Contrary to the leading positive review, a fix has been found for updating to the latest version. Please be aware that if you do not perform this fix FIRST before upgrading your modded router to the latest AC68U firmware, it will be crippled into a position that is difficult to recover from. The fix has you deleting some files that identify the router as a T-Mobile version to prevent the newer versions of the firmware from triggering the cripple code. If you trigger the cripple code, there are steps out there to recover as of the date of this review. All modding is done at your own risk.\\n\\nPerformance - I have no complaints. Even using the T-Mobile firmware, sub $50 is a heck of a deal for this router if you\\'re looking for something solid and cheap.',\n",

I even opened this one up and removed the thermal pads to be replaced with Arctic Silver 5 thermal paste, just to keep the heat dissipation working smoothly. I also install Asuswrt-Merlin on all these routers, and it is just super stable.\\n\\nThe only reason I ever have to reboot is for firmware updates / settings changes. Aside from that, it hums along like a champ all the time. I\\'ve never had connection issues with any devices, and the speeds are incredible, especially for local network transfers (i.e. MacBook Pro to NAS, etc). Obviously internet speed is limited by your ISP, but local network transfers go at just about full speed on 5GHz, and that makes moving files around a breeze.\\n\\nI get this router for all my friends who need a better home WiFi setup, and for all of them, it\\'s essentially a \"set it and forget it\" process.

I also didn\\'t have to create an account with a Chinese company or use a smartphone app to configure the mesh (although I can use an app to control it if I want).\\n\\nI also converted an older RT-AC56U that I already had to the same AC68U firmware and, viola, a 3 node mesh for less than $100 with the network configured with the settings I want.',\n",

The reviews seem to put this as a decent value with the firmware upgraded.\\nSo I bit the bullet and purchased one, hoping to get AI Mesh functionality.\\n\\nI received mine today and went online researching how to manually change the firmware and came across the recent bad news. As noted by another review, ASUS seems to have cracked down on this router and is disabling AI Mesh for this router specifically when upgraded to the latest firmware/CFE. There does not seem to be a real solution as of yet, other than reverting back to older firmare.\\n\\nHugely disappointing, so I will be returning this unit soon. I didn't want to advertise T-Mobile branding in my household anyway...\",\n",
       " '--------------------------------------\\nUPDATE - May 2018\\n\\nFor those who have experienced a \"forced downgrade\" to the AC-1900 firmware after attempting to flash the latest ASUS RT-AC68U firmware onto their AC-1900 (from either the April or May 2018 firmware upgrades on the ASUS website), there is a workaround/fix. It is rather complicated and will take some time as it involves the use of an exploit within the Web GUI to downgrade the firmware. If you follow instructions, however, you will be able to re-flash the firmware of your choice back onto the router. Search Google for more information.\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nWhat an awesome price for this ASUS router considering it runs about $140 or more everywhere else. First and foremost, ignore the T-Mobile badge on the router. I highly doubt this router is actually refurbished...it looks brand new, never-used. T-Mobile likely had an overstock of these and sold them back to Amazon. What you get is a neutered T-Mobile version of the ASUS RT-AC68U router...it\\'s neutered because of the preinstalled T-Mobile firmware. This product is actually a rebadged ASUS RT-AC68U, exact same hardware. Search Google for AC-1900 and you\\'ll find instructions on how to reflash this router to the latest stock ASUS firmware...it\\'s a multi-step process and you may want to have a tech-savvy helper do this for you. After installing the ASUS RT-AC68U firmware, install a custom firmware such as the Merlin firmware for the RT-AC68U which will allow you to overclock the router. Once the new firmware is on there, this router is ready to rock. It has a powerful Wifi radio with plenty of range to fill a 2500-3000 sq. ft. house with full signal throughout. Excellent router for an excellent price. Ignore the T-Mobile badge, it simply has T-Mobile firmware on it which can be replaced with a stock or custom firmware if you can follow directions properly.',\n",
       " 'Same as the Asus RT-AC68U for 1/3 the price. Very nice router. Mine came and looked like it was brand new, with plastic wrap still on parts of it. One word of caution. If you plan to install a different firmware on the router, be ready for a couple hours of work. The latest T-Mobile router ships with a firmware that will not allow other firmware upgrades and it has locked out Telnet. The process to get it all unlocked and switched to a different firmware is very involved. So if you want to use it as is or if you are willing to put in a couple hours of work to change the firmware, then this is a great router and value!',\n",
       " 'This refurbished router looks like new, I installed the latest version of the merlin firmware and it works perfectly.\\nIt came in a brown cardboard box with 1 set of antennas, network cable, user manual and power adapter.\\nIt has immense functions, although it is a little difficult to install the stock firmware of Asus or a modified one like merlin, tomato or others, it is totally worth it, for functionality and security, I followed the tutorial of \"bayareatechpros\" \"Flashing TM-AC1900 to RT-AC68U\"',\n",
       " \"This is an excellent dual band router, very fast and very reliable. I've been using a regular Asus RT AC68P for over 1yr with no downtime or other issues. I wanted to get this to replace an existing 2.4Ghz router that I was using to extend my network to cover a deadspot.\\n\\nFirst, the refurb unit I received looks like new. It was in perfect condition and came with the manual, an ethernet cable and a charger in a plain box. The only difference I could see from my AC68P was the T-Mobile branding on the front.\\n\\nThe first thing I did after unpacking was to swap over the firmware to Asus stock following instructions from bayareatechpros (search for ac1900-to-ac68u).\\n\\nI then upgraded to the latest Merlin WRT firmware, first by upgrading to Asus stock 378.xxx, then to Merlin 380.xxx. The intermediate step is necessary because of a change in how Asus has structured the internal partition tables.\\n\\nI now have the router running on the latest Merlin firmware as a Asus RT AC68U. The last thing was to put it into Access Point mode so that I could connect it to my existing network as an extender.\\n\\nThe whole process was somewhat time consuming but saved around $100 so was worth it. Another thing to keep in mind that Asus is currently beta testing its new AiMesh tech on a few of their models which will be rolled out to these ones in the near future. When that happens, these T-Mobile refurbs will be the absolute cheapest way to get a proper wifi mesh network with the next cheapest that I could find being more than $100 per node. On top of that you get all the powerful router tech that's already available.\\n\\nBottom line - I think this is the best deal out there for a dual band router at the moment bar none. To get a more powerful device, you'd need to spend more than 2x the money and would likely see no improvement in your network speeds.\\n\\n4y Edit: I bought an additional one of these and am using both with the newer AIMesh firmware (MerlinWRT) as nodes with my RT-AC68P as the main router. Neither of the T-Mobile units has given me any trouble other than needing to slightly change the firmware upgrade process due to Asus attempting to lock them out. The new process - updated on the same page I reference above - still works to get these onto the latest firmware. Note that this only needs to be done once. After that the internals will register as a stock Asus router and you can use their firmware or aftermarket like Merlin according to your preference.\\n\\nAIMesh works great and makes the nodes extremely easy to deploy and upgrade. Still highly recommended!\",\n",
       " \"UPDATE: 3/27/2018\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt now appears that Asus has disabled AiMesh functionality completely for anyone running a T-Mobile TM-AC1900 that is flashed to a ASUS RT-AC68U with its latest firmware update (Version 3.0.0.4.384.20624). Upon upgrading via the router admin interface, you will no longer see any AiMesh nodes nor anything to do with AiMesh, period. Also, after trying to reinstall the same updated firmware manually, my router was reset back to its original T-Mobile Firmware!!! What's worse, is that this may mean no future updates of any kind for TM flashed variants that are running AC68U firmware. Even Merlin over at SNB forums suggested somewhat cryptically that Asus is starting to tighten up on the TM-AC1900 routers and perhaps even his custom firmware won't work on them for much longer.\\n\\nWhile there may be a work-around that the community comes up with at some point, people looking for a cheap way to get mesh networking at this point should look elsewhere.\\n\\nBecause of this, I am lowering my rating by 1 star as this is no longer a great buy. Buying this for the T-Mobile firmware is an awful idea, as it is many revisions out of date and a huge security risk. You can still flash and update to the latest (as of today) Asus firmware, but beware that AiMesh no longer works, and there may no longer be any firmware updates, period.\\n\\nThe party is over for now...\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI bought 3 of these with the objective to flash them to the latest ASUS RT-AC68U firmware and configure them for mesh networking via Asus's latest AiMesh enabled firmware. 1 out of the 3 units was completely bricked and stuck in a boot loop, so I bought a fourth while returning the defective unit. I was able to successfully flash the 3 working units to the ASUS firmware, and then upgraded them to the latest AiMesh capable firmware. For some reason somewhere in the process my 2.4Ghz and 5 GHz wireless chips were assigned identical MAC addresses, which prevented the units from being able to see each other. I had to dump the fully updated firmware for each unit to my PC and edit the 5 GHz MAC address by adding 4 to it (in hex). After that, everything was smooth sailing. I have a 300mbps down/10mbps up connection thru my ISP and wired machines get full bandwidth. Wireless on the 5GHz band is between 180-280mbit/s from every corner of the house using the 3 units (1 master, 2 nodes) in mesh mode. Wi-Fi calls do not drop when moving around between units, so it seems everything is working fine. When using only 2 units (1 master/1 node), I get around 150-165 mbit/s on the outer reaches of my house, so 3 might be a little overkill for my house (2500 sqft).\\n\\nPS. When doing a speedtest with the T-Mobile firmware, my 300mbit download speed would use up to 100 percent of the 1st processing core and 65 percent of the 2nd processing core. On the latest ASUS firmware, that usage drops to 70 percent on the 1st core and 5-7% on the 2nd while maintaing the same download speeds. The T-Mobile firmware is super out of date and non-optimized.\",\n",

       " 'Background:\\nI\\'m using the WNDR3800 in a 3-story wood-frame house, in a medium-density neighborhood. The router is on the middle floor, and I get a good wireless signal throughout the house. I am one of those people who have good luck with routers; my last one is still working after 2 years, and the previous one lasted many years before finally dying. I bought the WNDR3800 because testing comparisons at smallnetbuilder dot com indicated that it would have a better wireless range than my old router, and have features that I wanted, like a guest network, built-in OpenDNS support, and a Traffic Meter.\\n\\nInitial setup:\\nI was impressed with how easy this router was to set up. I simply unplugged my cable modem, disconnected the old router, and connected the WNDR3800. I powered up the cable modem and the new router. I went to my wired Windows 7 desktop and pointed the browser to routerlogin dot net. I clicked on the big button that said \"Take me to the internet\". A few seconds later the desktop connected. I updated the firmware to V1.0.0.24 by clicking a button.\\n\\nWired networking:\\nMy old router used the 192.168.0.* address space, and this one uses the 192.168.1.* address space. Most of my wired devices, including my Windows 7 PC, Canon printer, TiVo Premiere, and Windows Home Server, grabbed a new IP address without having to reboot them. My two older TiVos had to be encouraged to get a new IP address by going into their network settings menus and selecting \"get (an IP address) automatically from a DHCP server\", but this took less than a minute and did not require restarting them. My wired Blu-Ray player had to be rebooted. Wired transfer speeds between two gigabit Ethernet devices (my desktop and the server) averaged 100 MBps (800 Mbps) for a 0.5GB file. Netflix streaming to my wired Blu-Ray player and TiVo works without stutters. DLNA video streaming from my home server to to a wired Blu-Ray player works great and is snappy. Both my husband and I use Cisco AnyConnect to connect to the VPN servers at work, and neither of us has had any trouble connecting through this router.\\n\\nWireless networking:\\nThe router is preconfigured with SSID names and a password for both the 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz networks. I dreaded setting up our two notebooks, Wii, three iPhones, iPad and a Kindle again, but it was as simple as selecting one of the network names, and typing in the easy-to-remember but hard-to-guess password. The 2.4GHz gives an excellent signal throughout our 3000 sq. ft. house. The range on the 5GHz network is somewhat shorter, but there are no other 5GHz networks close by to interfere. My iPad 2 is the only device that can connect to the 5GHz wireless network; Netflix streaming and DLNA streaming to the iPad works without a hiccup, one floor up and two rooms over from the router location. My iPhones and iPad are running iOS 5.0.1, and we have iTunes 10.5.1 running on our PCs; Wi-Fi sync between the PCs and the iOS devices is working well over both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks. The Clear Channel Selector worked as advertised. In my neighborhood there are six 2.4GHz networks on channel 6, two on channel 1 and one on channel 11; the WNDR3800 chose channel 9 for its 2.4GHz network to minimize interference from the other networks.\\n\\nAdministration:\\nSetting up parental controls with my existing OpenDNS account went smoothly, and now I don\\'t have to run the OpenDNS updater desktop client on my PC, because the router takes care of that. For my Windows Home Server, I was able to reserve a fixed IP address and forward several ports for remote access. I turned off UPnP, because I saw that my son\\'s computer was trying to forward several mysterious ports. The Traffic Meter, which is a great feature, is listed at the end of the Advanced Setup menu. The reported bandwidth usage seems consistent with what I had measured previously using the Tomato bandwidth meter. I found it easy to save current router settings to a file from the Advanced menu; I like to do this before a firmware update. The guest network was simple to turn on: just check a box, pick an encryption method, set a password and click \"Apply\". Guests cannot see other computers on my regular network, and I can quickly turn the guest network off when I don\\'t need it.\\n\\nOne week later:\\nThe WNDR3800 has been working perfectly, no dropped connections. I\\'m glad I bought this router, its wireless range is better than my old router and wired upload/download speeds are improved also.',\n",

After looking at the possible loading, I decided that using 2.4Ghz on G wasn't going to give me enough for smooth streaming to two or three different locations. I looked at replacing my NetGear Wireless router with a NetGear WNDR3800 to get g/n Dual Band to spread the load, and the NetGear Wireless-N Access Point for my heavy bandwidth bridge, and re-use my NetGear Wireless router as a 2.4 G access point for a low use segment. I used diagrams from the NetGear Manual to identify where in the network each piece should go in my design, and the configuration it needed. I set up the WNDR3800 to match my original router settings, adjusted security to WEP 128 bit, and put it in place. After updating the endpoints with the new security settings, everything attached without any problems. Next I set up the Wireless-N Access Point using the same SSID, security, channel, etc as specified in the User Manual, connected it to my isolated LAN segment, and immediately had sharing between the segments. I set up the original NetGear wireless router as an AP, and have multiple wired segments connected by two wireless bridges without any problems. I have tested both wireless bridges and the performance is outstanding. The WNDR3800 is supporting multiple PCs (wired and wireless), a Linux Server, wired and wireless printers, as well as wireless mobile devices like our phones. I have used many different brands over the last 15 to 20 years, and have come to rely on NetGear because it just works.\",\n",
       " 'I have mixed feelings about this wireless router. It has a very ambitious feature set but it is so obvious that the product was rushed to market before it was fully baked that it is impossible to rave about it without reservation. Fortunately, I got it after multiple firmware iterations had already been done since it was released this year. (currently at 1.0.0.25beta). So, I missed all the drama experienced by the one star reviewers (which tellingly make up a quarter of the reviews). There are some very good features. For example, the administration web page is nice. I really like that the radios are simultaneous. The range is excellent on 4.2GHz and very good on 5GHz. It sure is pretty.\\n\\nThings I do not like:\\n\\nI hate that after six months it is still a beta product and Netgear expects us to test it after paying a premium price. This is an industry-wide problem though. Still, we should not buy these kinds of products.\\n\\nThe default QoS setting for the 5GHz 40MHz wide n setting is incompatible for normal traffic with the two Ralink based adapters (Trendnet TEW-684UB and TEW-680MB) I have. Oddly, one has to select the somewhat obscure Wi-Fi Multimedia Mode setting for it to work at advertised speeds (Advanced - Setup - QOS Setup - Enable WMM settings on 5GHz). This should have been caught in initial QA testing. Yes, it may be a Ralink problem, who knows, but you need to test against the market.\\n\\nThe upright stand could have very easily been designed to slip into either side of the router thus allowing the finished side of the router to face either direction. As it is now, depending upon how your wires approach, you have a 50/50 chance that you will be displaying the unfinished back side.\\n\\nThe clear channel functionality is not of much value. Case in point a 4.2GHz environment (single width single channel n) with neighborhood routers on channels 4 and 5. Set clear channel on. It selects the overlapping channel 2 for my network. Turned it off and manually selected open channel 11. Worthless feature.\\n\\nPerhaps one of the most braindead marketing decisions Netgear has ever made is the disabling of the activity LED because it is too confusing or annoying to some. What is really annoying is the use of super bright LEDs intended for the flasher on the back of my bicycle. Use subdued indoor LEDs and let them serve their needed purpose. I should have read the reviews more carefully on this blunder.\\n\\nThe under-documnented TiVo functionality boasted of would be great but nobody at Netgear thought to actually test it with TiVo Desktop. If they had, they would have discovered that you can\\'t select network drives with TiVo Desktop. Without the Desktop interface you get a blank drive on the TiVo Now Playing List without much purpose. Sure, advanced users can simply edit the Windows registry to point to the media server network drive and it all works fine but there is no documentation to that effect and this router is supposed to be for non-technical end users that don\\'t need such things as activity indicators.\\n\\nAlthough, I don\\'t suffer the wireless dropouts reported by early adopters, I do several times a week lose my two hardwired servers. I can get them back by power cycling the Netgear. That is getting old fast.\\n\\nSo, it is not an awful product but it is not for the casual consumer in its present state and until Netgear releases an actual finished firmware clearing up the loose ends I can\\'t recommend it wholeheartedly.\\n\\n____________________________________________________\\n\\nEdit 2/23/2012: Nest, the WiFi enabled learning home thermostat company reports that Netgear routers are incompatible due to Netgear\\'s non-conformance to NAT specifications: \"Nest needs to be connected to the Internet in order for you to access and control it from your Nest Account. There are some routers that\\'ll incorrectly disconnect Nest from the Internet after 30 minutes or less of inactivity. Unfortunately, these routers don\\'t conform to the TCP/IP specifications around Network Address Translation (NAT) timeouts and are disconnecting Nest too soon.\"\\n\\nSo, if you have or are considering a Nest thermostat do not get this router. Current beta firmware is still incompatible. I have to knock off one star because I now have to actually get rid of it whereas previously I was willing to live with the abundance of annoyances in hope of a future fix.',\n",
       " 'I have used this product for at least 4 months now.\\nDoes what it\\'s supposed to do most of the time. USB port is a 2.0 port and as such is slow and as traffic is always passing through the router, USB port stays active which will not allow an external HDD to \"go to sleep\" when not accessed for a while. I would like to see that fixed in f/w if at all possible.\\nAlso, occasionally requires a reboot (power switch on back is pressed \"out\" for off and \"in\" for on. when wireless devices try and access. This seems to happen randomly and has required me to reboot the thing at least once a week. Again, that aside, it continues to be a good product which was recommended to me by a DirecTV tech. to solve a problem with one of their devices which did not seem to get along well with my last router, which was going on ~~five years.\\nMaybe a new f/w update would fix some of the anomalies I am seeing--need to check. Anyway, they ALL have one glitch or another if you use them heavily, so pick your battles. This one I would certainly recommend to friends or clients.',\n",
       " \"I've been very happy with this router after about a year of use.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Easy to setup and configure\\n-Love the Open DNS and the ability to filter out websites we don't want anyone visiting\\n-2 accounts plus a guest account is a great way to manage access\\n-This has so many features it's mind-boggling. Want to turn off internet access from 11PM to 7AM to keep kids from playing when they should be sleeping? No problem, this router will do it. And a whole lot more. But even with all that, it's still easy to use and set up.\\n\\nCons\\n-I do find we have to reset the router every now and then because we lose internet access. Honestly though, I'm not 100% positive it's a router problem. Both router and cable modem are on the same switch, so I just cycle power to both and i'm usually back up and running in a couple minutes.\\n-Coverage is not as good as the Linksys WNDR___ modem I used to have. It may be that I just need to put it in a better location, but i found now I only get 2 or 3 bars, where I used to get 4 or 5 with the Linksys.\",\n",
       " 'The review that appears below presented my initial impressions of the router following a week of use. After 6 weeks or so of reliable service, I suddenly lost and could not re-establish a stable internet connection. The resolution of this situation consumed fully two weeks of effort involving work with ISP techs who came to my home, replacement of my cable modem, and finally, marathon telephone sessions with Netgear support engineers who seemed prepared to spend as much time as necessary to make my router work properly. This entailed several hours of time on the phone with them, including sessions in which they established remote control of my laptop to make adjustments to the router. All of this work ultimately culminated in a decision to provide a replacement. On one level, the devotion of Netgear support staff to the task was commendable; however, the amount of time required of me--the customer--amounted to fully two days of time on the phone or pursuing solutions suggested in email messages from various support engineers. After a point, it is unreasonable and inconsiderate of customers to expect them to invest such time in obviously defective equipment.\\n\\nSince receiving and installing the replacement unit, I have enjoyed a reliable signal and the router has effectively managed connections from a dozen of more devices that exist on our home network. Based on my initial experience with the initial router and my current experience with the replacement unit, however, the signal broadcast by the 3800 does not reach as far as the older Netgear WNR2000 wireless-N router for which the 3800 was a replacement. This has been disappointing and has rendered one internet-capable TV useless for watching Netflix. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend purchasing this router.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nSomewhere along the way, my \"home network\" went from a couple computers sharing an Internet connection to a complicated system that encompasses not only tablet, laptop, and desktop computers, but also: a wireless printer; VOIP telephones; Internet-ready TVs, BluRay players, and receivers; smartphones; an external hard drive hanging off the router; and a satellite-TV DVR that is shared across three TVs. Layered on the hardware comprising the system are different operating systems, including Android, Windows 7, and Windows XP, as well as different media servers associated with the various devices. In today\\'s world, an effective router can\\'t simply provide good throughput of an Internet signal, it must accommodate diverse hardware and software, and facilitate the connections that make a home network a useful and efficient means of sharing information and entertainment content.\\n\\nAfter a week or so, my experience indicates that the Netgear WNDR 3800 meets the basic requirements of such a home network. I didn\\'t experience the connection problems other reviewers described, perhaps because I followed their advice and downloaded the beta firmware upgrade (1.0.0.19) and the subsequent official upgrade (version 1.0.0.24). Connections are generally faster than with the Netgear WNR2000 I had been using and the range seems as good. More important, we\\'re now getting consistently reliable and fast connections with a couple devices that formerly were temperamental.\\n\\nWhile I have had a generally positive experience with this router, prospective buyers of this router (or any other that will be used as the hub of such a network) should anticipate an investment of time and effort to optimize connections. Also, don\\'t be surprised if you end up with no devices connecting to the 5 Ghz \"sub-network.\" Perhaps the next generation of equipment will adopt this standard, but it does not seem to be built into a lot of recent and current devices; however, the four gigabit Ethernet ports on the router do seem to speed up some connections (e.g. Netflix streaming to a BluRay player).\\n\\nThe router is shipped with a unique SSID and a pre-assigned network password. This avoids the risk of earlier routers (and lazy users) of defaulting to the manufacturer\\'s name as the SSID with no password requirement. It facilitates quick and secure installation. Further adjustments can be made simply by logging into the router via routerlogin.net (unfortunately, the login username and password are the old standbys, thereby creating an entry point for hackers unless they are changed).\\n\\n[UPDATE--In January 2012, Netgear issued an updated version of the application described below that addresses the login problem.] The Genie application is supposed to be the means for making such adjustments, but it has yet to allow me to login to adjust wireless settings. Netgear support reps have been very responsive in trying to help me resolve the problem. The following excerpt from one of their email messages summarizes the unique types of information available through Genie:\\n\\n1. A graphical map of all the devices connected to your network. The router GUI can only lists the information in text format.\\n\\n2. Computer Internet connectivity diagnostics and auto repair, desktop Genie can help detect and auto fix many wireless related issues for example, of course, if you rarely experience any wireless related issue on your computer, then this feature might not be very obvious.\\n\\n3. The \"WiFi Connection\" allows you to connect to another AP easily, without worrying about 3rd-party wireless managemenmt utilities like those from other manufacturers. You can also see the channel number of APs in your neighborhood, standard Windows utilities do not provide this feature\\n\\n4. Integrated Parental Controls management so you don\\'t need to download the stand-alone management utility.',\n",
       " \"I was in the market for a new router because I needed gigabit ethernet and my wndr3600 did not have that feature. Adding a gigabit ethernet switch solves the problem for my wired computers but limits wireless to wired transfers to 100mbit instead of the 300mbit wireless maximum. Therefore after plenty of research (lots and lots) I found my way to an ASUS RT-n56u, Netgear 3700, Netgear 3800, Netgear 4000 and even a Buffalo w/ ddwrt and a high end linksys.\\n\\nWith all those routers the big things to decide between was do I get one that can support 450 wireless, do I go for the one with DDWRT (very advanced and powerful firmware), or the one bye a trusted we dont play around kind of company ASUS.\\n\\nAfter reading all those reviews I came to the 3800 because of 2 things:\\n1) 450 wireless adapters are uncommon and are not inside my macbook, my dv7, my ps3, xbox, iphone, or ipad. According to the reviews the 3800 had the absolute highest 300Mbit performance so going with a 450 capable unit would actually degrade my performance until 450 found its way into consumer devices.\\n2) This unit supports TIME MACHINE which made me very very happy (although after receiving it and learning of its 300GB limitation most of the happiness was gone)\\n\\nSo hear is my detailed review which is broken down into a few categories.\\n\\nFeature set ***** 5 Stars - As far as features are concerned the only thing missing is 450mbit capability now that would be enough to loose half a star but because almost nothing comes with 450 and this thing will out perform other 450 routers while they are in 300 mode it isn't that big of a deal. Add in the fact that this thing has readyshare cloud (a cloudless feature) and the ability to support Time Machine backup in lion (although only up to 300GB) and that more than makes up for its lack of 450mbit wireless!\\n\\nPerformance ***** 5 Stars - As far as performance is concerned I am quite happy since the only thing that could be faster would be a 450mbit router but if wireless card isn't 450 capable then this router will actually out perform any 450 capable router on the market when they are in 300mbit mode. Since almost nothing comes built in with 450 I decided that it isn't even something important.\\n\\nEase of use **** 4 Stars - I am not a big believer in owners manuals. That said I am in the tech world and a lot of my time is spent answering questions that people should not be asking me. I believe people need to consult the manual then do a google search before calling technical support or asking a sales person how to do something. Therefore it is the software engineers and the project managers responsibility to ensure this doesn't happen. There should be something built in that makes it impossible for people to have any issues.\\n\\nMy 2 issues that knock 1 star off when added together.\\n\\n1) When you plug your modem and computer in this thing should function immediately. If for any reason it wouldn't function a sticker should have been on the device warning you of anything that may stop you up. Netgear did a GREAT job on this router with those bits of information. Such as the default SSID and password which are unique not standard. Unfortunately when I plugged my modem and computer into the router the internet did NOT work immediately. What makes matters worse is entering 192.168.1.1 in the browser did not pull up the router even though ipconfig did show that to be the routers ip address. I had to plug my macbook in and open up its browser to find the router. So for some reason it did not like my PC at first. After my macbook talked to the router my PC could see the internet.\\n\\n2) I plugged in a usb hard drive and although I really doubted it would work like magic I had my macbook look for a Time Machine. It did not find one which was no surprise. So into the router setting I go! I found nothing in settings that would explain my issue. No Time Machine checkbox, no link to explain the requirements of the time machine nothing NO HELP at all. I had to open the manual and turn to page 83 which explains that the drive must be HFS (but never says HFS) and it must be GUID or MBR. It also explains that you have a max of 300GB back up. This is actually very limited. I have a 500GB HD in my macbook, although it is not full because of the way Time Machine works a computer with just 200GB of data on it could easily end up with a larger than 300GB Time Machine backup. I honestly think that Netgear should work hard to resolve this issue and I also think they should highlight this limitation anywhere the feature is listed.\\n\\nUnique Features *** 3 Stars - This router has 3 unique features. They are all mediocre at best. I wont bother explaining what the features do just what is wrong\\n1) Clear Channel - Only important if you are using 2.4GHz instead of 5GHz and you live in a congested area (apartments/condos). Even then advanced reviews have this feature pegged as a possible trouble maker and could even result in lost performance.\\n2) Readyshare cloud - This is NOT a cloud feature at all. Your files are in a HD plugged into your router a feature that most routers have. Most routers can even grant you access to these files remotely. The difference is instead of having to remember ip addresses that could change and which port to use this program acts as the middle man and makes it so all you need is a user name and password. It is kinda like using some 3rd party remote access program instead of the built in windows desktop sharing. They just make it easier and in case your ISP changes your IP address you wont loose the ability to connect. Do not let yourself think that this is in any way a replacement for true cloud programs that sync files across multiple computers. If netgear adds that ability then even though its still not cloud it will truly be an awesome and unique feature.\\n3) Time Machine - the need for you to consult the manual is one thing but the 300GB per computer limitation is a big problem when a computer with a mere 200GB of data on it could use up more than 300GB of Time Machine space.\\n\\nMy conclusion: Buy this router if it is in your price range. There honestly is not a better router. Now if you do not care about readyshare cloud (not really cloud based) or TIME MACHINE and price really matters to you then I would recommend you write down which features are most important to you and find a $60 router that has those features. You can get 80% of these features in a router for $60 it just depends on which 80%. But if you can afford $130 there is no better router regardless of the price. I would be willing to spend $200 on a router if that would have made it better but it would not have. One other thing though is if you have a Macbook with Lion or higher and you have over 200GB of data that needs to be backed up you may want to get an Apple router. If you have a Mac desktop computer then just plug an external in and don't even worry about a router.\",\n",

It's not able to keep a strong enough signal or handle a lot of devices and still supply sufficient speed. Also, even if you live alone and wan't high speeds, be aware that although you may have a higher speed coming from your ISP, the WAN (ethernet) port on the device can only support a 10/100 mbps connection, like a Cat5 cable would. So you won't be able to take advantage of higher speeds than that regardless of what you pay your ISP for.

       " \"I am very satisfied with my home network and it is exceeding my expectations. I wanted to set up a small home network for two PC's in a two story townhouse condominium. High speed access is provided by cable modem and I have an HP Officejet K80 connected to a USB port on a Windows 98 desktop PC. My other PC is a Dell notebook running Windows 2000.\\nAfter reading numerous Amazon customer reviews on wireless routers and adapters, I decided to buy the following:\\nRouter - Linksys Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL router (BEFW11S4 v.2)\\nWireless network adapter - Netgear MA401 802.11b Wireless PC card\\n10/100 Lan card - Linksys LNE100TX 10/100 Lan card\\nTotal Cost - about $210\\nI chose the router because Linksys seemed to have less problems than other brands. I chose the Netgear wireless PCMCIA adapter because users reported excellent signal strength over varying distances and it had a built-in antenna. I also didn't want to use my one USB port on the notebook for a network adapter. The Linksys 10/100 Lan card was just a great buy for under $20.\\nSetup was relatively straightforward. I installed the 10/100 Lan card first into my desktop PC and then connected it to the cable modem just to make sure the card worked properly. Next, I followed the quick start instructions for connecting the router to the cable modem and to the desktop PC. Then I used the setup wizard on the CD to guide me on configuring the router. At one point during the router configuration, I had to power off and on the cable modem before the router detected the Internet. Once it did, it automatically picked up the information it needed to configure the router with my ISP's assigned addresses. Note: the network patch cable that came with the Linksys router is only about a foot long, so you may want to get a longer one.\\nOnce I verified the desktop was accessing the Internet through the router, I setup the Netgear wireless PCMCIA card for my Dell notebook. Again, I just followed the setup instructions and it connected to the router without any problems. I placed my notebook PC on the first floor of my condo and the Netgear utility program showed the signal strength and link quality at 100% or Excellent. The router is on the second floor approximately 30 feet away and about 3 feet off the floor.\\nOnce I set up file and print sharing on the desktop PC, I was able to print easily from my notebook to the HP Officejet K80 connected to my desktop. The only quibble here is that the desktop PC has to be on for the remote printing to work. I may invest in a Linksys Etherfast Wireless USB Print Server (about $80) if it gets too inconvenient.\\nThe last thing I did was read the Router's user's guide to set up the WEP security for 64 bit encryption. I used a passphrase for both the Linksys router and Netgear wireless adapter and it worked without a hitch. I also changed the router's web-based utility default password for additional security.\\nAll in all, I found the setup to be straight-forward and I did not need to talk to any technical support people. Every product I purchased lived up to the reviews that I had read, so I hope this review will help someone, too.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this router over 5 years ago when it first came out, and it served my needs just fine the whole time. I live in a 3000 square foot single story L-shaped home. The router was positioned at the vertex of the L and was barely able to cover the furthest rooms in the house. I finally decided to replace it this year with a higher performance model (D-Link DIR-655) supporting the new wireless standards (802.11g and 802.11n). The Linksys router worked fine for supporting my wireless needs for web browsing and it even did a pretty good job wirelessly streaming music around the house. It was a little slow with streaming photos though and definitely wasn't fast enough to stream DVD quality video reliably. When we needed to perform large (hundreds of megabytes) file transfers between computers, we usually ended up plugging in an ethernet cable, because the wireless file transfers were too slow. In general, for an 80211b router, this router did a fine job, lasted a long time, and was easy to setup. I can't comment about the Linksys support, because I never needed any support. I'm deducting 1 star however, simply because in this day and age, nobody should be buying a Wireless-B router anymore. I suggest that you invest a few more bucks (if that much) to get at least a Wireless-G router with the same features. If you have devices that support Wireless-N and you can afford a hundred bucks for a router, then I suggest the D-Link DIR-655.\",\n",
       " 'I purchased the Linksys router (V2) along with the WPC11 card (V3) just last week, and am pleased to report that both are running exceptionally well, especially considering that I live in NYC. Many negative reviews have been posted about this suite of products, and perhaps some are valid, but most are backlash from earlier versions of each component working (or not) with each other. Linksys seems to operate on the belief that getting a product out into the marketplace with a few kinks is better than getting it out there perfectly (and therefore with a significant time delay to market), and I respect that rationale (think of how many service pack updates you\\'ve had to do with any of your Windows operating systems over the years! ) Below describes my experience thus far with this suite of products; your experience will likely be different if you have a different OS, have lots of 2.4GHz phones in your house, your house is make mostly of steel, etc. But we\\'ll get to that....\\nBACKGROUND:\\nThose of you who are looking to get into the wonderful world of wireless networking should freshen up on the good, the bad, and the ugly of what the 802.11 standards are. A good resource is 80211-planet. This site has several articles (search for \"Jim Geier\" or \"Minimizing 802.11 Interference Issues\") to help explain why you can potentially expect interference depending on the location and conditions around either your router or your network card. Bottom line = there are many variables that can affect performance of any 802.11 product, but you won\\'t know unless you dive in and give it a go.\\nINSTALLATION:\\nI\\'m running a Thinkpad T21 laptop with W2K, and have RoadRunner for cable modem service (Toshiba modem). I popped open the box for the Linksys router, briefly skimmed through the long booklet directions, and then carefully followed each step of the 1-pager quick-installation instructions. The router connected to the cable modem without a hitch (note that RoadRunner uses DHCP...what\\'s DHCP you ask? Go to webopedia and do a search on DHCP for details). Please note that I used all of the default settings. Time to connect cable modem to router and router to laptop = 11 minutes.\\nI then popped open the box for the network card, and again followed the directions line-by-line on the quick instruction sheet that came supplied with the card. Once again, I used all of the default settings, and lo and behold, the card began communicating with the router without a hitch. Time to connect the card to the laptop and the now \\'networked\\' laptop to the router = 7 minutes (including software installation).\\nPERFORMANCE:\\nI live in a duplex in lower Manhattan, and so at first I was skeptical in light of the reviews I had read before about performance relative to distance from the router, etc. However, I am able to move anywhere on either floor and get a consistently good signal (the router is upstairs and I\\'m writing this downstairs, whilst streaming music...no lags). I have downloaded hundreds of MBs worth of data thus far without any problems, streamed music and videos, emailed, surfed the web, uploaded files, etc. I\\'ve connected another wired computer to the router and it connected without a hitch (again, make sure you\\'re familiar with DHCP...makes things a lot easier). The signal did fade to a whisper when I went outside, but I\\'m not entirely surprised, given that the router was 3 floors away, and trying to communicate through several walls of brick, wood, and steel. I\\'ll probably toy with the position of the router in the house to see if I can boost my response outside. I haven\\'t tried a network game yet, but then again, I\\'m not using the laptop for that purpose. I also haven\\'t attempted to update the firmware of the card (as it prompts me ever so often to do) yet, as it is working now. Instead, I have placed an email to Linksys for their recommendation, and will post an update to this review when I have an answer.\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\nIf you\\'re ready for the wireless world, the Linksys set of products work very well, especially now that they (and Amazon) ship the latest version of each. Some helpful tips:\\n- Don\\'t install the router next to a 2.4GHz phone or a microwave\\n- Placement and positioning of the router and antenna are key. Just as Rome wasn\\'t built in a day, getting your wireless network up and running smoothly may take a bit of fine-tuning.\\n- If you find unbearable interference, change the channels. Just like on your portable phone, you can potentially see dramatic improvement.\\n- Make sure you have an extra CAT5 cable around for the installation. You\\'ll need one to connect your DSL/cable modem to the router and then another to initially connect the router to your computer.\\n- Tinkering can get you into trouble! If you don\\'t know what a configuration is, then don\\'t tinker with it...a classic way to burn your fingers on the hot stove of curiosity.\\n- READ THE DIRECTIONS! Following each step slowly but surely in the short-run can significantly reduce your headaches in the long-run.\\nIf you\\'ve done your research, you should know by now that no 802.11 product is a panacea for every possible wireless situation. It simply may not work for your home or office, given the variables in play. But like the intrepid explorers who found the new world, you too can find happiness--and new working freedom--with a wireless network....',\n",

My investigative curiosity was aroused enough to go check out the Linksys web site where I learned that there was a manufacture rebate that was available. To make a long story short, I bought my router through Amazon, sent in the rebate form and ended up with a final cost that was $10 less than anything available through the auction sight. Count me as a happy customer!\",\n",
       " \"I purchased this router along with two WUSB11 wireless USB Adapters. This is a good product. Good speed and great signal strenght. If you are wondering why I gave the product four instead of five stars? Its because of Linksys' poor technical support and awful documentation. We have PAC Bell DSL using a SpeedStream 5360 DSL Modem. It literally took three evenings after work calling Linksys Customer support to get the router to connect to our DSL line. The first call was answered by a tech who did not have a clue and after 90 minutes of changing different options she advised me to download the firmware and reflash the Router. Having done that and still no luck, I called back the next evening after work and got a fellow who told me to connect to the Internet by bypassing the Router and then switch the cables to connect the DSL modem to the router. When I explained that I could not do that because the Linksys documentation instructs you to uninstall PAC Bell's PPPoE software - his only reply was try it and it will work.\\nOf course this failed so I called back again the next night after work. The tech explained that they have had problems getting the Router to work with this SpeedStream Modem. He promised to email me a patch. After waiting an hour for an email that never appeared I called back and demanded to speak to a supervisor. He apologized and explained that the problem lies with the SpeedStream Modem. He pointed me to a forum in DLS Reports which contained a link to SpeedStream's site. There a found a firmware upgrade to the modem and after I installed the upgrade - the Router worked flawlessly. I am disappointed because it took FOUR calls to tech support before I was given the proper information.\\nThe WUSB11 cards are attached to my daughters PCs located in two separate bedrooms on the second floor of our house. They installed and connected to the router without a problem. So we now have a total of four PCs networked to our DSL line. Two upstairs and two in our downstairs office. The downstars PCs are connected via CAT5e cables to the Router. All connect at 1 megabit per second so I have no complaints. Just remember if you have a PAC Bell DSL SpeedStream 5360 Modem, you may need to upgrade the firmware to get your router to work properly.\",\n",
       " 'Let\\'s call this rating 4.5 stars ... I purchased the BEFW11S4 router along with the Linksys PCMCIA card for my home desktop system and laptop, respectively. Basically I wanted the ability to surf the Web from my laptop anywhere in the house (in bed, on the sofa, watching TV, etc.) using the wireless connection but also have the hard-wire ports available as a backup. I\\'m using the wired port from my desktop that is located 70 feet away in another part of the house where the DSL line/modem live, but the wireless connection via my laptop to write this review. All I can say is so far so good and no real complaints. The only reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars was some of the setup/config I had to do eventually wasn\\'t covered in the manual and I had to call tech support at 800 number to get up and running. The quickstart setup and driver installation takes about five minutes total for both the router and the card and I had absolutely no trouble following the directions. I knew the card was connecting as it was clearly getting a signal, and there were a couple tweaks that the tech support operator helped with immediately. The basic problem I had was with DNS ... I had to enter some basic DNS server settings in both the router and the card\\'s TCP/IP properties and immediately began surfing the Web! Pretty cool. Tech support was solid, responsive, friendly ... but like most these days really overworked. It took me a day to get a callback but once I did, no problems. They even gave me some good advice for extending the range of the wireless service, such as trying different channels, antenna positions and downloading a new driver from the company Web site. That\\'s something none of the other reviewers who had problems mentioned trying, but very sensible. I should also say that I consider myself a novice network admin at best. The real selling points for me were the price/feature set and the PC World \"Best Buy\" recommendation. The $40 in rebates I got at the time I purchased were an unexpected bonus, but unfortunately no longer offered. OK, so it wasn\\'t 100 percent plug-and-play, but anyone who deals with networking -- home or office -- will tell you some minor tweaking is to be expected. Don\\'t be discouraged or let this prevent you from diving in -- I\\'m glad I did!',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve never networked anything before using this, and I have successfully created two different wireless networks. I used the BEFW11S4 to set up a wireless network in my two story house (~1500 square feet), and I don\\'t have a dead spot in the entire house. Not only that, but I am able to use my laptop at the pool, over 100 feet away. It was a little bit tricky to set up because the router had the same IP as my modem. But after getting this figured out and simply changing the IP of the router (which is extremely easy with the setup utility), the network worked very well.\\nNow I am in a house in Mexico which is made out of solid concrete and rebar. This does create an issue with distance, but we fixed that by setting up the router in the middle of the house, that way we still get our 11 Mbps here in the office and on the other side of the house. The greatest benefit of the router, though was its MAC address cloning ability. Even though our ISP here limits our access to a single computer which it recognizes (I learned after a couple hours of messing around with different options) by the MAC address of the network adapter card, we were able to connect an entire house of computers (>5) with the hub by simply (again using the awesome configuration utility) having the Linksys router change its MAC address to match the network adapter of the old computer. Now we have wireless access in the states, and we can bring the laptop to my parents house here in Mexico and instantly get service here.\\nPROS\\n*Can use inexpensive ISP service to a single computer to give internet and network access to multiple computers.\\n*Can offer both wireless and wired (up to 4 computers wirelessly) connectivity.\\n*Maintains speed up to 50 feet away through 3 6-inch walls filled with concrete and rebar.\\n*Easy to set up.\\n*Great configuration/setup utility which is accessable through a web browser (firmware is also upgradable by downloading an update from the website.)\\nCONS\\n*It does show a loss in speed or even in connectivity in certain \"dead spots\" in the house. (To fix this, you just scoot over like 3 feet in either direction and it goes from 0% to 50%).\\n*Poor customer support over the phone.\\nI bought a second one based on my experience with the first one. As I discover more and more about what this unit is capable of doing, it makes me more and more willing to recommend it. So that\\'s what I\\'m doing: \"I recommend that you get this router/WAP.\"',\n",
       " \"I wanted wireless, and I wanted a wired home LAN, and I wanted to share my cable modem Internet connection with the above, and I needed a great deal of flexibility. I picked Linksys after checking out the browser-based interface, which for my money is the easiest net configuration interface I've ever used. And I'm delighted I did!\\nI'm a long time Apple user, but Apple's Airport is so idiot-proof that it doesn't really offer the level of customizability that I needed. Linksys fit the bill perfectly. Here are the features I particularly loved:\\nMAC cloning. My cable company knows which computer I've got hooked up to the internet, because they keep track of the MAC address of that machine's interface. If I change machines, I have to re-authorize - and if I change it to something that's not an Apple or PC, then it won't serve internet at all. That ruled the Airport out. With MAC cloning, Linksys fools my cable company into thinking that my Apple is still connected directly to the cable modem - I never have to re-authorize.\\nNAT/Port forwarding: I run a couple services on my box. It can be hard to configure this for access behind a router, but with Linksys it's the work of about a minute. I didn't even need to read the manual - it was just done.\\nWireless security: you can easily turn OFF SSID broadcasting, turn ON 128-bit WEP encryption, and easily change your admin password. And you'd better do all those things if you don't want someone stealing your bandwidth.\\nRemote configuration: If you leave this on, you're leaving yourself open to security problems, but you can turn it on just long enough to let a friend help you configure the router. Makes it easy.\\nDHCP/Static IP: By playing with the settings you can make DHCP and static IP assignments peacefully coexist on both your wired and wireless LAN.\\nMAC access list: when enabled, only specific wireless devices with a particular MAC address can connect to your wireless network. An added layer of safety, much appreciated in high density, bandwidth-starved Manhattan.\\nAnd after all this configuration was done, the machine acted as a firewall and started logging intrusion attempts - and man, I never knew there were so many hackers out there!\\nTip: If you're having trouble, manually reset the router with the physical 'reset' button. I had to do this once before the router would operate properly, but since then, no problems!\\nI'd buy a Linksys again and I recommend you do so as well!\",\n",
       " 'I bought this Wireless router after doing quite a bit of research and getting good reviews from co-workers (even network guys) on it. I have owned it for almost 2.5 years now.\\nI will break this down step by step:\\nInstallation:\\nCouldn\\'t be easier. Had the whole thing setup with my Cable Modem and my desktop in less than 30 mins and was surfing the net. in an additional 30 mins or so had my wireless laptop going and didn\\'t have a single problem. Switching from an Orinoco or a Cisco wireless card on the laptop was easy and no problems there either.\\nInitial Usage:\\nIt had problems. It would keep stopping and requiring a reset or a full power down/power up. I updated the firmware (keep on top of firmware updates) and this problem went away. Updating the firmware is very very easy.\\nPerformance:\\nI will review only the wireless part this. For internet browsing and basic stuff, it performs great. No complaints here. It was a little slow on some of the more heavier network utilizing applications but its wireless you can\\'t expect the speed of a Lan line.\\nRange:\\nI didn\\'t have problems with ranges in my townhouse. It worked everywhere without any degradation. When I moved to a two story colonial, I started to see some range problems. It would work fine on the floor where the router was. On the ground floor however it would move from excellent/good to fair frequently. Sometimes just turning the laptop a certain way would do miracles. I never had a complete dropoff though. Never did try the basement :-)\\nFeatures:\\nI couldn\\'t have asked for a more easy to configure and more featured router for my usage. Supported all the protocols (IPSEC/PPOE) for me to VPN to work. Had nice control over ports and traffic. The control of DHCP and static IP addresses was nice too. Didn\\'t use much of the other features.\\nNow with all that said here comes the BAD part:\\nabout a month ago, the wireless part stopped working. I was surprised at first. I checked the router. Lan activity Lights were on but not the wlan activity lights. I hit the reset button no go. Checked my desktop.. the lan connection was fine. Did a full power down and power up. Still nothing. Checked the website for firmware updates (in case I missed one that fixes something).. nope I had the latest firmware. This was on a friday so I just let it be. Saturday.. still no luck. After going nutz on Sat, I finally emailed Customer Support on Sunday. They responded fairly quickly (within hours) and after a couple and back and forth emails.. the response: \"This can happen if you are under warranty we can replace it\" Well the warranty is a bleak 1 year and I had had this router for 2 years...soo.. bottom line.. I am getting a new router and probably not going with Linksys again. A response of \"This can happen\" is not acceptable to me.',\n",
       " \"I've owned other Linksys products in the past and that make a great router so this one should be no different. I was really surprised when I opened the box and noticed that the factory bag was still wrapped around the one I ordered and still factory sealed. it looked like it had never been taken out of the factory bag. according to the information in the ad the legs where supposed to have scuff marks on them. it's kind of hard for that to be the case if the router has never been taken out of the factory sealed bag. my money was well spent in this case. However I would like to add and this has no bearing on the product itself.

The router covers roughly 80% of the home, which is pretty good; the signal is punching through multiple walls to achieve that coverage. (If I could position it on the first floor near the center of the home, I suspect it could cover the whole home.)\\n\\nHowever, the claim that you can \"simultaneously link up to 35 wireless devices\" appears to be quite incorrect. I have nearly 100 IOT devices in the home (mostly WiFi switches, but a bunch of other things -- cameras, thermostats, garage door openers -- nearly everything except the toilets can be operated via WiFi, and the toilets might be next....) This router appears to \"top out\" around 20 devices. You can link more than that to the router -- I had linked just over 30 devices -- but continuous connectivity seems to drop once you get above 20. And unlike other routers, when it starts dropping devices, it seems to drop just about EVERYTHING (I had 2 devices remain in a connected status; not sure why). I started moving devices to another router; once I dropped below 20 devices on the Tenda, the connections seemed to become stable. It\\'s now been a couple of days, and I haven\\'t seen any devices get dropped; this is with roughly 18 IOT devices connected.\\n\\nSo, if you\\'re planning to purchase this router to cover a large volume with a small number of clients (phones, laptops, and whatnot), it\\'s a pretty good router.

Please look at the pictures that I\\'ve attached to help you in your decision. Also keep in mind that not every house is built the same.

I thought that was really bizarre considering that usually you get a strong signal through denser material at 2.4 as opposed to 5.0. I tried this several times and that was the end result. This was also about 60feet away from the router/wifi going through plaster and brick.\\n\\nOutside the 5.0ghz was consistently at 220mbps (via my iPhone 10X).

Win10 Home (1903) did not automatically install drivers so I downloaded and installed drivers from the FebSmart website, which installed without a hitch.\\n\\nHowever, the speedtest results on all three computers were extremely disappointing. After checking the properties of the connection, I found that it was connecting at only 2.4Ghz... which negates all of the advantages of AC speeds including MIMO and beam forming. Usually dropping down to 2.4GHZ is the result of a very weak signal (b/c 2.4GHz has a longer range than 5GHz), but the computers were only one to two rooms away on the same level. These are some steps I tried:\\n• I thought maybe the computer case was blocking the signal, but turning the case so it was not between the antennas and wireless router made no difference.\\n• I tried two different connections: first a TP-Link 1750AC router, then a high-end commercial grade Ubiquiti AC access point. Same results.\\n• Finally I tried shutting down the 2.4GHz transmission on the router to force the wifi cards to connect at 5GHz, but the wifi cards could no longer even see the SSID — that provided me with the clue I needed... the cards were not operating at 5GHz at all!\\n\\nAfter poking around deep in the wifi driver properties... I finally found the problem — for some inexplicable reason, the driver's default setting was to run in 802.11b mode only (the slowest possible connection)... No wonder the speed was so abysmal! Additionally, your router could also be set to restrict wifi connections to specific modes which could result in unstable connections or even prevent connections altogether if this wifi card driver is restricted to modes not aligned with the router settings.\\n\\nThe default mode I found might not be true for all installations or driver versions (this driver is 4.0.3.262), but if you run into an issue of extremely slow transfers or connectivity issues then checking the following might solve the problem:\\n\\nDevice Manager / Network Adapter / Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4 / Properties / Advanced / Wireless Mode:\\nThe mode choices range from 01 (11b) to 12 (11a/b/g/n/ac). Changing the mode from the default of 01 to 12 immediately resolved the problem. There are a few other modes which also support AC but restrict other connection speeds if you prefer. There is one other setting which could be significant: Preferred Band which defaults to 'No Preference' but can be changed to 'Prefer 5GHz'.\\n\\nAfter this crucial driver tweak, the connections are now blazing fast!

But the app didn\\'t display the IP addresses of other devices so with the limited ability to intervene with the app (and no web interface) I don\\'t know how to reach those devices.\\n\\nMultiple restarts doesn\\'t solve the problem.\\n\\nI saw on the Eero community site that a number of users are experiencing the same thing. I reached out to Eero support via email and was assured my issue would be addressed shortly. That was two days ago, and I suspect Eero is scrambling to try to find a solution. I bought two Eero 6 Pro routers based on the specs and, you know, Amazon. But I refuse to spend well over $400 to be a beta tester. Fortunately, I saved the packing materials because they\\'re going back.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nOriginal review: Easy setup, great speed and features I bought two Eero Pro 6 routers. They arrived in two days as promised.\\n\\nOur house is only about 1800 square feet, but I have an office at the far end of the backyard that can barely get a wifi signal from the house. Until now we\\'ve used an Apple AirPort in the house and a Netgear wifi router in the back office connected by an underground Cat-5 ethernet cable. It works fine, but our iPhones and laptops get confused as to which network to connect to when we move back and forth between the house and the office. I had been considering a mesh system for a while.\\n\\nWe have AT&T fiber and an Arris gateway in a closet in a back room of the house. I put the gateway in IP passthrough mode and let the Eero assign IP addresses to our connected devices connected to a Netgear gigabit switch. In the back office the wifi signal was strong enough for a wireless mesh with the house Eero, but I used the wired LAN because it\\'s already here.\\n\\nI was initially disappointed in the speed and signal strength in our living room, which is only about 25 feet from the back room. I then followed Eero\\'s recommendation and moved the device, just slightly, away from other electronics in the back closet. Signal strength on our Fire TV Stick immediately went from \"fair\" to \"very good.\" And we\\'re getting the full 100 Mps (and then some) up and down that we pay for. I placed the back office Eero on a wooden ledge to get it away from my equipment rack. No issues whatsoever.\\n\\nThe icing on the cake is the elegant design of the Eero iPhone app. It allows you to name and categorize connected devices, something the Arris gateway would not.\\n\\nVery pleased with this purchase.',\n",

       " \"I received my Pro 6 mesh wifi router today and just installed it. This router is outstanding, I love it! I had the Pro 5 mesh router before, which I bought back in March when my kids started their homeschooling. The Pro 5 had been an improvement over my old Apple AirPort Extreme, and I was relatively happy with it. Still, I was disappointed that I was not getting a strong signal in my 2nd bedroom in my 1000 square foot New York apartment. Standing near the router with my Pro 5, I got about 200 Mbps, but as I moved about 35 feet away and around a corner in my apartment, I was getting only about 10-20 Mbps, which was not good enough for having two kids on Zoom calls at the same time. I installed an Eero Beacon in the back bedroom, and that got it reliably up to about 60, which was good enough for the kids to not complain of glitching on their calls.\\nI felt a bit sheepish about wanting to try the new Pro 6 mesh wifi router, because the 5 was good enough with the Beacon, and I don't own any wifi 6 enabled devices. Did I really need to throw away another $229 on a new toy for a theoretically small improvement in wifi strength? Well, the answer is absolutely! I ran a speed test near the new router and got the same approximate 200 Mbps, but when I went to the furthest spot on my back bedroom without a Beacon, I got about 150 Mbps. The improvement in performance is astounding, and I think it will be a life-changer for those of us with multiple kids at home with constant video calls. With the Pro 5, I made sure that I wasn't watching any videos on my laptop while the kids were on their calls, because invariably, one of them would shout that their video was glitching. My network simply couldn't handle three devices using that much bandwidth. But now with the Pro 6 mesh's ability to handle more devices, plus the astounding extra coverage, my entire apartment is blanketed in blazing fast wifi. Plus I love the Eero's fun and easy features on the app. I pay the $29 a year for the Eero Secure, so I get the ad-blocking, plus the ability to filter out inappropriate content for my kid's devices. Even without the Eero Secure, the app has great features and is very simple to use, but I do like the Eero Secure.\\nSo, my verdict is that the new Pro 6 mesh is a home run, and I'm so thrilled with it. Two other things: I read a lot of reviews about the Pro 5 mesh running very hot, and it was absolutely true. Mine ran hot, but I didn't find it alarming, like some other people did. This Pro 6 mesh runs much cooler, it is just warm to the touch. I find that much more reassuring. It is about twice the thickness and has a slightly bigger footprint than the 5, but the 5 was pretty tiny. This is still sleek and stylish, and looks attractive out in the open. I kept the box for my Pro 5 mesh and Beacon, and will sell it on Ebay. This Pro 6 mesh is an outstanding router, and eliminates the need for a Beacon to extend its range in my apartment. It’s a huge upgrade from the Pro 5 mesh, and is well worth the money spent, even if you have no wifi 6 enabled devices. It greatly exceeds my expectations.\",\n",

They have no clue how to help again, because this was obviously a rushed product. These firmware updates seem to cause more problems then they fix too. My internet speeds started off great but then plummeted all of a sudden below broadband levels (I haven’t seen 5mbs speeds since I first upgraded to DSL 20 years ago). I’m sorry - I love Amazon products and the whole ecosystem but I do not appreciate purchasing a product and not being told I’m actually just a beta tester in reality.

I have a gigabit connection at home, and I\\'m starting to get Wifi 6 devices, so I was excited to have the latest from Eero, which I\\'ve purchased not only for myself, but for several relatives and friends over the past few years. This upgrade is fine, but not great, and I\\'m starting to get frustrated by the limitation of Eero\\'s software.\\n\\nMy setup is one Eero Pro 6 as the gateway, a second Eero Pro 6 that is ethernet-connected to a desktop computer, and a last-ten Eero Pro to add coverage in the farthest part of my apartment. According to Eero, this last one shouldn\\'t be necessary in my 1000 square foot, single- floor apartment, but it is. The range technically reaches to the bedroom, but speeds are abysmal, dropping from ~500Mbps on a wifi 6 device to ~50Mbps. With the last-ten Eero Pro, they\\'re at 150Mbps, which is fine. But the point is the \"range\" that Eero quotes doesn\\'t account for declines in speed, which very well may mean you need more devices than you expect.\\n\\nMy second issue is with the device I have connected to my desktop via ethernet. With this setup, the (non-Wifi 6) desktop jumped from ~500Mbps to ~800Mbps, which is great. The issue is that it screws up the connections and speed of all the wireless devices in the area. A phone or laptop would normally connect to the gateway Eero, and be able to pull 500Mbps (on Wifi6), but because the desktop is \"too close\" to the gateway, if the phone or laptop connects to that node instead, it only pulls 150Mbps.\\n\\nIf Eero would listen to their customers and allow for the ability to turn off wifi, just using a device as a mesh ethernet bridge, this would solve the problem. It could also be solved by allowing users to manually \"prefer\" certain nodes for certain devices. Or for the Eero system to just be smart enough to know to always prefer the gateway, which will always be faster than a node. Users have been asking for these options and upgrades for years, but Eero declines to provide them.\\n\\nEero is still great for an easy no-hassle setup. I\\'ll probably keep it for my parents.

There are regularly 9 devices active on the network, sometimes a few more.\\n\\nAt first I purchased the Linksys AC 3200. After all updates, I was not impressed. That router was performing worse than my old one, kicking random devices off like it was stuck on its device prioritization. I’m not sure, but I had to return that after giving a few days trial after changing the settings. Then found this mesh system, looked around and compared but kept coming back to this one... figured I could return if it didn’t work too. So, why not order it I guess.\\n\\nI’m glad I gave it a shot. Far superior to my old TP-Link. I have coverage in rooms that I didn’t before, including the garage. I went with the router + two nodes. Which could explain the amazing coverage, since my house is basically half the maximum spec’d coverage. I could have gone with the router + one node probably, but for a few bucks more I have killer coverage.\\n\\nInstallation was a piece of cake. Plugged in the router (main unit), using the app only took a couple minutes and I was ready to plug in the nodes. They were already paired, so I just had to plug them into some zap-zap juice and all was good. None of the devices have been kicked off the network in the few weeks we’ve been using it. The signal is flawless all throughout my house and garage. The seller is great, the shipping is fast. So far the router hasn’t failed. Literally the best outcome,',\n",
       " \"You are on your own if you buy this product. The App doesn't work. I'm somewhat technically savvy and it took me 2 nights (4hrs each night) to get the system operational.\\n\\nAccessing the website is equally as frustrating. When connected to the Mesh System as the difficult to follow instructions lay out -- I can reach the dashboard 1 out of 20 attempts. I don't get it.\\n\\nIf it works flawlessly for the next month I'll keep it otherwise I'll buy the Google Mesh.\\n\\nThe products appear to be decent quality and the packaging was good -- as expected from the photos of the products.\\n\\nI'm holding out hope the system now that it's set up does well with minimal headaches.\\n\\nMy takeaway is how can a company sell to the masses --through Amazon -- and sell a product that doesn't have a functioning App or website for support. It's not a well thought out plan to go to market.\",\n",

       " 'I am not impressed by general tech reviewers anymore who\\'s always super impressed by the specsheet without having a device run through its paces in realistic settings which also include the experience of firmware upgrades and changing conditions where they operate.\\n\\nI\\'ve read many bad reviews of this device. I found this device to be great. In fact I got it for $450 soon after it came out, and lately I\\'ve seen it go for as high as $250. It\\'s still receiving updates and unlike tp-link it\\'s not abandoned for a v2 of the device. Netgear makes solid devices. Yet, I can confirm the internet rumours, they do give up at the software and support level.\\n\\nThe default firmware is very difficult to use (I didn\\'t deduct a point for this). I deducted a full point because of 4 things, 1) it doesn\\'t allow for a proper view of what devices it\\'s serving. I\\'ve also seen many devices go unreported. The \"Attached Devices\" page is less than useless. Best way to find out connected devices was a work around, trying to add a static IP lease to a device it gives a readable list, yet this is incredibly inadequate 2) it can only handle and allow 1 subnet (I am now wiser and know that I can get a much more powerful router from mikrotik that can handle many while allowing a lot more freedom to experiment) 3) while it can do VLAN, there are some weird restrictions on it rendering it unusuable for use as a VLAN configured switch in AP mode 4) it\\'s generally advised to keep router firmware up to date, but in the case of Netgear I found it to not be a great idea. It appears Netgear from time to time releases firmware that can brick a device. It may be best to move onto voxel\\'s or another 3rd party firmware (especially after warranty expires). The 3rd party firmwares although not always at the same version level, seems to be more stable and less risky.\\n\\nSo 4 big problem for a pricy device and yet why do I deduct only 1 point? Mainly because they do market this product for home use. For home use it\\'s quite a powerful plug and play beast. Most home users will be extremely satisfied with the features and performance. Wifi signal is plenty strong. The 2.4GHz signal covers whole house top to basement floor of a combined 3000 sq ft. 5GHz has some deadspots as expected.\\n\\nI found ALL features of this home NAT gateway beast to be useful and useable EXCEPT the AD wigig signal. I couldn\\'t find a way to make use of it. I simply had to turn it off so I don\\'t have unnecessary crowding of RF. The 10G SFP+ port is sweet. I found many decent priced transceivers to use with it.\\n\\nOn a last note, this was going to get me into becoming a Netgear household and then I stumbled onto the nightmare of dealing with their customer service for a different product (Arlo). So I\\'ve now given up on Netgear for my future home needs. However this beast has been performing beyond my expectations for almost 4 years now, serving 100s of devices with very minor hiccups. I still recommend this device to a new customer who can have this for $250-$300. Keep in mind the AD wigig will be useless and it will be a beast of a plug and play home router. It\\'s very much comparable to the latest AX wifi routers which are sold at a much higher price point. Also this one has a 10G SFP+ port, which makes it only one of 2 home wifi routers that I\\'m aware of having this feature.',\n",
       " \"I bought this router in hopes it would increase signal strength in the far corners of my house and outside, which it did.\\n\\nBut during the two weeks I tested it, the internet signal frequently (1-3 times per day) disconnected from the devices attached to the ethernet ports. All wireless devices remained connected to the internet--in fact, the wireless worked perfectly and the signal strength was GREAT. But, I use a hardwired Xbox One for my primary media center and a hardwired Samsung SmartThings Hub to run the dozens of smart devices in my home, so this was a deal breaker.\\n\\nI have years of experience setting up residential and small business networks. I tried every possible configuration of the router; I searched the manufacturer's knowledge base; I searched internet forums; and I tried multiple firmware versions... but the problem persisted. I wanted to love this router--so much so, that I bought a second one (I presumed I must have received a defective unit). But the second one had the same problem with the hardwired devices disconnecting... AND the replacement also disconnected wireless devices from the internet randomly. Maybe I'm unlucky and received two defective units... but I'm not taking the chance that third time's charm.\\n\\nI have now gone back to using a TP-LINK Archer C7 AC1750 that I bought from Amazon in August 2015 for less than a hundred bucks.

       " 'I had reached a supported limit of 25 Wi-Fi devices connected to the Wi-Fi router provided by my local telephone company. I decided to make an investment in my home network and get a high-end, expensive Netgear X10 Nighthawk. My expectation was that this investment would be worthwhile since I have a lot of Wi-Fi devices such as multiple Alexa devices, streaming sticks, a Playstation and mobile devices. This Wi-Fi router has been a major disappointment. The Wi-Fi constantly drops connections numerous times daily for both the 2.4G and 5.0G frequencies. Researching online I have found that this is a VERY common problem. The Netgear communities are filled with users with this exact issue. Upgrading to the latest firmware, turning off QoS, turning off the 5G band have had no impact. I have tried numerous channels as well. I am so disappointed I paid a premium for such a faulty product. I would highly encourage anyone considering a Netgear router to research \"Netgear Wi-Fi disconnections\" and see all the problems existing customers are having and then find an alternative product. I am a technical professional and well versed in computer networking. This is the worst piece of tech I have ever bought. I\\'m hoping my pains can be a warning to others so that they don\\'t spend a premium on a device only to be extremely disappointed.\\n\\nUPDATE So...after 9 months of WiFi dropping every 20ish minutes , Netgear FINALLY released a new firmware to address the issue. This is very bittersweet. My WiFi issues are resolved, however, why the hell did it take so damn long for Netgear to fix this when the Netgear support boards were screaming about this issue. According to the support boards there was a timer issue that dropped WiFi every 15 to 20 minutes. New firmware was released Jan, 2019.\\n\\nI stand by my decision to never buy Netgear again. Nine months to address a crippling issue for their “high end” router is unacceptable. I would look strongly at Asus as an alternative.',\n",

       " \"I bought this router for a six primary reasons:\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\na ) Strong performance when handling a large number of connected devices\\nb ) Ethernet Port Aggregation via 802.3ad (LACP)\\nc ) Strong WiFi performance (though there are competing routers which may be a bit better)\\nd ) Six Ethernet ports on the router's switch\\ne ) Active antennas\\nf ) Dynamic Quality of Service (QoS)\\n\\nFor anyone with MINIMAL experience with networking equipment, or general networking knowledge, I have some advice for you.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1. Download and read the User Guides and Documentation for this router (see link) https://www.netgear.com/support/product/R9000.aspx#docs\\n2. Follow the step by step directions and pay attention to any WARNING messages in the documentation\\n3. Ideally you'll want to place the X10 in a room that is in the center of your house but if you need to play it in an edge room in your house then pair it with the NETGEAR Nighthawk Mesh X6S like I did to prevent WiFi dead spots (mostly applies to larger homes or people looking for the best performance).\\n4. Backup your settings on the X10 once configured (it's just a good idea).\\n5. Once everything is set up, download the latest firmware (I did this via the web-interface, it's easy).\\n\\nA little more detail below\\n------------------------------------\\nFor my personal setup I started by downloading the manuals at NETGEAR's website for this router. I read the manuals just to make sure I did things in order because every company does things slightly different and it's good to know how your particular hardware is meant work (and when it's ready to do things). I mapped out my network (just draw a diagram of your house, the locations of your networking hardware, and connection type) and I determined where I would place my X10 router (and the X6S extender I purchased separately). I connected my modem and router and then the primary PC in my home using cat6a cable and performed initial setup of the router. Once the router was connected, in a working state, and ready for modifications, I logged into the web interface and I modified the settings that applied to me (enabling QoS, changing the default password for the router's login page, enabling Ethernet port aggregation, setting priorities for devices, downloading firmware, etc.). Then I connected the X6S extender to this router via two NETGEAR Powerline 1200 Mbps (PLP1200) ports and cat6a cable. I set the X6S up in access-point mode (you can do extender mode but access point mode will give you the best performance in most cases if the wiring in your house is good). I ran tests in every room of my house and my WiFi signal was full-bars at all locations and the speed test results confirmed that my WiFi performance was consistent throughout the house (the loss or gain was NOT meaningful). This router is able to handle a large number of connected devices without slow down (from the router, you may have slowdown due to high bandwidth usage but that is not the fault of the router, that is a limitation of your internet connection). Today at my house we had 18 devices running on this router and it ran without any issues. I have had 0 disconnects, or sudden drops in performance (WiFi or wired) from any devices connected to this router.\\n\\nSimply put, if you want a great router then buy this one but make sure you learn how to get the most out of it before buying it, otherwise, there are other similar routers with a few less features that might save you some money and fir your needs better. Also, at least for larger homes or people looking for the very best WiFi experience, pair this with the X6S (and place them in ideal locations) and if you want to go crazy like I did set up a power-line Ethernet connection between the X10 and the X6S using cat6a Ethernet cabling so the X6S can be run in access-point mode instead of extender mode.\\n\\nI love this router and I hope it lasts me 5 years like my previous router (which was still in working condition but couldn't handle the processing requirements of my household). If I had to be critical of NETGEAR for anything it would be that a 1 year warranty is simply laughable for a router at this price point. This company needs improve in this area in particular. I have had good interactions with NETGEAR customer support and I plan on staying a NETGEAR customer in the future but a 1 year warranty is a joke and a premium router deserves a premium warranty. I hope that eventually NETGEAR puts a strong warranty behind all of their products but especially their high end products and learns from companies like Samsung (who I buy all of my SSD's from partly because of their 10 year warranty on the 850 Pro) because a strong warranty is a way for the company to say that they believe in the reliability of the product and NETGEAR doesn't do that currently. Other than the abysmal warranty, this router has been flawless.\",\n",

       " 'UPDATE: I have to say that for the first 6 months or so the router was great. I have a huge issue with this router that started 6 months in. That was when I lost power for the first time. I could not get my wifi devices to come back up or connect to the router till I changed the SSID and had to manually connect all of my devices. Again 6 months after that the same thing happened. I had to change my SSID and had to add everything back took hours. Today I did not lose power but for some reason my wifi went down. I did everything I could possibly think of I even did a factory reset again and made the SSID\\'s the same just to see if the devices all reconnected but no. So I had to do another factory reset and change the SSID and now that I have moved more to smart plugs and switches along with google mini\\'s and just lots of devices this is a BIG issue. I can\\'t even contact Netgear and have them swap out the router in case the hardware is defective because I am out of warranty. I would say if you have more than a dozen or so devices in your home this might not be the one for you. I know I have tried over the past year to get answers to why this is happening and no one has given me a reason just lots of try this and try that with nothing working. This is why I moved this device from a 4 start to a 2 star.\\n\\nIn today\\'s era everything is about \"Internet\" and \"Home Networking\". As an IT Professional I find myself helping many people setup home networks but my main time with networking is trying to perfect mine. My household is a household that has 3 gamers, 5 streamers, and lots of data moving. From lots of console gaming, video streaming, file share with plex, and lots of IT stuff my network is always put to the max. This is where I finally decided, even though I couldn\\'t really afford it, to buy what appears to be the router I am looking for.\\n\\nAfter months of research on different routers I finally decided to go with the XR700. With gaming being one of the biggest parts of my home along with streaming either from my plex server or from Amazon Prime to at least 3 tv\\'s at the same time it was time to pull in a big piece of equipment to see how it would do. After 6 1/2 days of using I wanted to give my initial thoughts on what I have found and I will be doing another more in depth review for my site at in a few weeks. But here goes..\\n\\nDesign:\\nThe design of the router is probably one of the best I have seen. It isn\\'t to bulky looking that I wouldn\\'t want to have it scene but it also isn\\'t small. It is a fairly large size router compared to any I have used in the past but it looks great and it has mounting holes so I was able to mount it on the wall outside my server closet. I give it 5 out of 5 for design.\\n\\nSetup:\\nThe setup was pretty simple. I did have to restart the router twice before it finally went all the way through the setup getting me into the interface but it wasn\\'t to big of a headache. I has simple instructions on screen and the setup interface was easy to understand even for those who are not as tech savy as an IT specialist. Setup gets a 4.5 out of 5 mainly because I had to restart it twice.\\n\\nWeb Interface:\\nThe bulk of this equipment and probably why it cost so much is because of the web interface and the brains of the router. The web interface is vast and has a lot of stuff to configure and look at. I do feel that if you don\\'t have a lot of tech background then you may feel a bit overwhelmed with the looks. I even overlooked at least 1 item that the software actually offered but because there was so much I didn\\'t see it. I contacted their tech support asking why it wasn\\'t there and they had to tell me where to find it. This feature I am talking about is the VPN feature and I was hoping to use my own. Well you can use your own as long as they allow for OpenVPN config file to be downloaded!\\n\\nYou can control which devices gets priority with the bandwidth which is nice for gaming and for streaming. I was able to place my boys and my xbox\\'s to where if we was playing it would give us priority of 60% of the bandwidth before giving what is left to any other traffic like video streaming. This is a great feature. Not to mention features like geo-filtering, VPN allowing to give only certain devices VPN coverage, traffic monitoring, and many other normal router features. However, one feature I feel should of been included and I was told by their support team that they are looking into this, is a parental controls feature. My last nighthawk router finally included \"circle with Disney\" feature which si great when you have kids and a lot of devices in the house. Not having a parental control feature included in a new router like this is a huge downfall, especially paying the price I paid. Overall the interface is vast and has a lot of great options and features that I have been looking for to put on my home network but I also lost one of the most important feature, parental controls, that I feel is essential with today\\'s online threats toward kids. Because of what is missing I can only give it a 4 of 5.\\n\\nCost:\\nHere is where I have to say is the biggest issue of the device. I probably should of waited longer before I decided to get this device but with my Nighthawk I currently have losing wifi 4 to 8 times a day I finally said it was time to get a new router and this was the one I kept coming back to in my research. I feel it only has a few extra features compared to some of the less expensive ones and some of the features you can get on the less expensive ones, like parental controls, isn\\'t on this one. At best, after a week of using the product, I would say it is a $250 router. I paid $200 for my previous nighthawk AC1900 and that one I would say was at best a $100 router. So cost I give it 3 of 5.\\n\\nOverall:\\nMy overall view of the Nighthawk XR700 is that it vastly improves the speeds of my devices and has helped illimanate a lot of the buffering I had with streaming videos. It also has allowed my games run smoothly so far and I hope to test out how it works with all 3 xbox\\'s playing on the same game soon but we all have been able to play at the same time on different games with no issues. The interface is vast and has lots of features. Some features like parental controls need to be added as soon as possible and is a must. The VPN section is what I have been looking for in a router which allows me to assign which devices I want to use the VPN and which devices I do not. The setup was pretty easy to do as well. If you can afford to pay the price of this router and you are a big gamer/streamer then this probably is one you want to consider. If you are not a big gamer/streamer of videos then I would not recommend this router but maybe the the Nighthawk AC1900 for it did great for me. My overall rating on this product is 4 out of 5. Even if they finally come out with a Parental Control feature which they must I would still give it a 4 out of 5 as long as it is over the $250 price range.\\n\\nHope this review helps those who are on the fence.',\n",
       " 'This review is for the XR700. Not the xr500. It seems that the reviews are mixed up on here.\\n\\nWe have an existing asus rt66 we’ve had for years. It didnt appear to be maximizing our dl speeds and lan transfer rates so we decided to upgrade. After reading reviews I decided to take the chance on this expensive router.\\nOut of the box it connects easily and setup is a breeze. Everything is straight forward.\\n\\nSpeed is pretty dramatic compared to my old router with download speeds around 330mbs. This is what service from the isp suppose to be based on my package.\\n\\nLike the Plex media service aside from if you want to maximize the service, you must subscribe to a service plan that is fairly costly. The iphone app is a nice tool but for full use you must pay a one time fee of 4.99 to watch streaming video without the 1 minute limitation interruption.\\n\\nGaming is why most users want to like this router. Unfortunately, my experience was disappointing for repeated service interruptions and “disconnects” that occurred during the routers useage. Firmware updates showed an improvement but the interruptions, while less impacting over the factory firware, are still super annoying. I realize companies rush to deploy technology for profit driven reasons, but reputation needs to mean something. Sorry to say, at least this close to launch, more product evaluation and testing should have occured for a 500.00 price tag.\\n\\nI decided to return this router after speaking to Amazon tech support and their claims of this router having many reports of the issue of disconnectivity.\\n\\nIm currently considering the xr500 as an option but taking more time to seek more information before buying.',\n",
       " \"I spent about 18 hours trying to get this router to work. Most routers I have worked with before were pretty straight forward to setup. This one is a little more difficult. For one thing IP6 was not enabled. So, my iPhones would not even connect. Even after connecting to the router, I could not get to the internet. That was not my biggest problem though. I have a lot of devices on my WiFi and a lot of things on ethernet. Things on WiFi include the include iphones, Ring Doorbell, Fire Stick, Various Lights/power switches, and a laptop. Some of the lights and my laptop would connect Wifi. All the others would not. I have three desktop PC, two Roku's, a Fire Stick and three TV's. I have one PC connect through a switch directly to the router (ethernet) and it connected fine, but my TV, Roku and Fire Stick would not. My other PC's via ethernet over Power line (Netgear) adapters. I could not get anything that were connected to them to get an IP address from the router (DHCP wouldn't work). I have a laptop that worked fine over WiFi but couldn't connect via ethernet unless I plugged it into the back of the router. I did do a hard reset on my Netgear Power line adapters a few times and the router. I still could not get anything to connect via the Power line adapters. I also installed a Netgear Switch SW10 directly to the Router. At first it worked fine then stopped. I put my older dump switch back in and my PC that is directly connected started working again.\\n\\nMy original Router was working fine with my setup. Before installing the new router and switch I did a firmware update. I also configured them. First I put the switch in and everything connected fine on that part of the network. When I added the router is when I started having issues. The switch stopped working and I put the old one back in to eliminate this as a problem. Then I found all the other issues. After working for around 18 hours on this, I finally put my old router back in. Almost everything connected back up without any intervention. I did have to power cycle one of my Echo Dots. Also I had to disconnect and reconnect my iPhones to the WiFi. I then put the Netgear Switch SW10 back in and was able to hard reset it. Then set it back up. It is working fine now.\\n\\nThe strange thing about this is the router having issues with other Netgear components. Needless to say I'm returning this item.\",\n",
       " 'I’ve had issues with this router ever since I bought it. It would come and go with internet service and I thought it was the service provider. I call them to come out and check their system as they did. We found out that it was the router. As you can see from pic that the plastic from unpacking it is still on the router. I really couldn’t believe the other technician that the router was bad because it was less than 3 months old so I brought it home from my ranch to my house to try it there and sure enough it was bad. Therefore I’m finally able to track down Netgear phone number and call them thinking to get it replaced. They put me thru all the test to see what lights are lit and what color they are and because this time they were all lit and while she says that they show everything is working and in order to go any further with me I needed to buy an extended tech support for $50 before she could send me to a technician to find out if it was defective and issue me a new machine because by the time I got around to calling them is was slightly ove the 90 days of tech support to find out if the machine is bad that is warranted for a year. Not only is that a scam on Netgear’s part but it is deceptive to their customers. I bought this thing on amazon because I could get it quick and thought Netgear was a reprinted company and paid$460. I needs something that could handle a lot of traffic for when grand kids came to the ranch. I have 4 houses and Netgear in all of them. It’s really had to believ they would treat their customers like this but they have. Therefore if you EVER have trouble with a Netgear product and are more than a day over their 90 day limit they will hold you up for more money for them to connect u to a technician to see if the product that is warranted for a year is really defective. Their policies suck and are meant to deceive people to buy their products thinking they have a year warranty but it will cost u money to prove that they need to warranty it. Go elsewhere if you can. I wish they had 0 star ratings; they would have a big goose egg from me. And I never write reviews so you know it has affected me enough to spend this much time on one.',\n",
       " 'On paper, this is way more than we need. Although we are only minor gamers with the occasional Fortnite session, it was more the capabilities of maintaining solid WiFi connections to LOTS of devices I was after. Sadly, this firmware is just too glitchy. I have many things hardwired to a switch and networked to the router. These things had no problems maintaining solid speeds, including the PS4 that Fortnite is played on. It handled Fortnite beautifully.\\n\\nFast forward to installing several items for our Smart home including 11 smart plugs/power strips, and nearly 20 smart light switches, 4 Alexa, 3 iPads, 4 phones, and one MacBook. Most of the switches and plugs required 2.4GHz connections. When they worked, it worked well. But, suddenly I was experiencing drops in wifi devices for no reason after a power cycle. Nothing would connect back, everything said it was connected with no internet access. I spent days (and nights) either reinstalling firmware, complete factory resetting, studying studying and pulling my hair out. From what I could tell, the router itself just wasn’t divvying out IP addresses and maintaining them so things could connect to the internet.\\n\\nA firmware update released during my nightmare and I thought it was fixed..... yay! Until I connected the smart switches back to the network. They stayed connected for about 24 hours then everything was disconnected again.\\n\\nSave yourself a headache and find another router if you’re looking for something to run your smart home devices.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ll start by indicating that I\\'m an IT Director with over 22 years of network engineering experience. That said, I\\'ve already initiated a refund for this item. Here\\'s my take:\\n\\nI loved the DumaOS, how responsive the admin interface was, as well as the amazing throughput of the device. I imagine for most people, this is a grand upgrade from Netgear routers of the past that are great when working but require a decent amount of administration and yes, reboots. The signal strength was exceptional throughout my 2600 sq ft home. The features of the admin OS was intuitive and informative. The monitoring features, alone, are such a step up from Netgear routers of old. This device is also quite \"future proof\", incorporating a bevy of connection options that I (and most people) don\\'t yet have access to. It boots quickly, and it was rock solid reliable for the few days I was using it.\\n\\nFor all the features, there was one deal breaker, and that was random ping spikes when gaming over wireless. After several hours of configuration, I was able to reduce the occurrence of these interruptions, but I was unable to eliminate them, altogether. These spikes were also present in accessing the Internet for general web browsing, but the average user would likely not notice them. (My wife streams lots of podcasts, though, and she *did* notice a slight difference in the stream continuity.) Every 5-10 minutes, I would get a 200-400 ms latency spike across all of my devices. I configured the \"anti-bufferbloat\" settings in every way possible. I prioritized my console before all other devices. I disabled the 60 GHz channel along with any other feature or service I didn\\'t need. I even went through half a dozen antenna positioning configs in vain despite my better judgement that this would not be a possible cause of my problem. Nothing resolved it except putting my old R8000P back into serivice.\\n\\nI will deal with occasionally needing to reboot my router, and I will deal with sometimes having to import my saved settings to repair a lost config, but I cannot live with that lag spike. Perhaps it was just my unit that had this issue, or maybe it will be fixed in a firmware update, but I just cannot justify spending $500 router with these shortcomings.\\n\\nThis was my story. Your mileage may vary.',\n",

I can easily pull down 85 mbps in the living room and 70mbps in the rooms furthest from the router, so that is a win for me.\\nI love being able to use the mobile app from my smartphone to manage access for connected devices from anywhere.\\nThe router does run a tad warm, but it is no warmer than the wrt160n that it replaced.\\n\\n5/5 would recommend.\",\n",
       " \"UPDATE (2016-01-08):\\nPlease read the full review for my thoughts so far, as well as a few details on the dropped connections (on my end, at least). My rating will not apply for everyone, and my personal experience with this router so far is probably somewhat different from yours. I rate it a 5 out of 5 because it fulfills all the requirements for my own use case, but I have NOT tested all of the functionality as it is beyond the scope of those requirements. I will update this review again if the situation changes.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\\nThe reviews for this router seem rather mixed, so I was a little worried, but since it was on sale for $40, I figured I didn't have much to lose. I should mention my use case for this router. I needed it for a townhouse, which is already serviced by multiple routers and APs, and bought it to fix a dead area that used to be serviced by an old WRT54G. After it shipped, I dropped a February 2015 build of DD-WRT onto it and so far, it seems to perform quite nicely. I should mention that DD-WRT isn't officially supported on this router, but some builds of DD-WRT for the ASUS RT-AC56U work, due to the two routers having similar internals. Do a bit of homework on this before attempting, or you may risk bricking the router. Haven't done any speed tests yet nor do I plan on conducting any, since there are no specialized requirements here (yet).\\n\\nI'm not sure where the complaints about this router's range are coming from, actually. Granted, the range is nothing amazing, but it's hardly bad. My unit's range not only exceeds the original WRT54G's by a significant amount, it easily punches through the building's thick floor and walls. It's actually kind of overkill for its job. Maybe there are some quality control issues involved and I got a good unit, but I'm inclined to think that the complaints about range are highly exaggerated. I should also mention that I placed it on top of a table, which may be helping somewhat.\\n\\nI will update this review if the situation changes.\\n\\nUPDATE 1 (2015-09-19):\\nI hadn't noticed before, but this thing gets awfully warm compared to the WRT54G. I'm not sure if it's a problem with DD-WRT or if the router naturally gets this warm, but based on other reviews and given that it's a lot faster than the WRT54G, I'm willing to assume it's the latter. It's a little bit worrisome, but I'm not seeing any performance degradation, so the rating stays put. I also had intermittent problems with Internet connectivity, maybe once every 5 to 10 minutes. I was actually prepared to knock out a couple of stars for that, but I did some research first, and after adjusting the wireless channels and firewall settings, it seems to be behaving itself now. The connection issues might have been totally unrelated to the router anyway. I will update this review if it starts dropping connections again. The USB printing doesn't work for me. Since I'm not running stock firmware, this is hardly surprising and I will not change the rating for that. The range of this router is also a bit lopsided, as some people have suggested. It seems to have better signal from the front of the router than from the sides.\\n\\nUPDATE 2 (2015-10-06):\\nIt still drops connection once in a while, but not so much that it's really problematic. The 4* rating stays and I think I can adjust the settings to resolve it.\\n\\nUPDATE 3 (2015-11-25):\\nAfter some further assessment, it actually appears to be the WiFi driver on my computer that causes the dropped connections. This thing might be better than I thought it was. Still not willing to push it to 5* yet, though.\\n\\nUPDATE 4 (2016-01-08):\\nCan all but confirm that the dropped connections are a result of my WiFi driver. For this price point, I'm going to increase it to 5*. Please note that this change of rating reflects how the router fulfills my own personal use case, and may not apply to you! It meets all the requirements that I had of it - a 802.11ac capable DD-WRT router that's inexpensive, stable, and has passable range. However, I still don't know how the router performs without DD-WRT, and I still don't know how well the USB port works (I have never needed it). Now that I know what's causing the problems on my end, I can resolve them.\",\n",
       " 'As most of the people who bought this router commented, this router is highly unreliable.\\nThe router is easy to setup and also has a good feature to access the router settings through the linksys website. This also enables the router to be configured while you are not connected to it. While this router works, it is pretty good with an exception of a short range for the 5GHz band. Even in an apartment of 2 rooms the 5GHz range halves when access it from a 2nd room, and it drops to 1 bar when upon leaving the apartment. The 2.4GHz band however, has a solid range and I have no complains about it. The router provides a good speed on both the bands. The usb feature to access the external hard drive works flawlessly in my brief testing. All in all the router works fine when it works.\\n\\nThe problem with this router is that the router just stops working after few hours. The only resolution is to reboot it. In my use I have to reboot it 2 times a day. This is very annoying and frankly was not expected from a product by Linksys. Just to be sure I am also on the latest firmware. I think I should better try my luck with a TP-Link router.\\n\\nUpdate: 9/22/2015------------------------------\\nAfter going back and forth with Linksys tech support the router is still dropping internet connection. Its time to send it back and going with other brand. Goodbye Linksys, you used to be a great brand!',\n",
       " \"Pros: For the few hours at a time where it works, it will work quite well. The speeds on both 2.4 and 5 ghz bands were just fine however...\\n\\nCons: The router cannot maintain said speeds for any appreciable amount of time. Neither band would remain stable for multiple devices (HTC One, logitech revue, toshiba laptops etc), all devices using wireless n. A reset of the router would correct this for a very short amount of time, then it would revert to being extremely unstable (multiple disconnects, varying speeds at times dipping to .7 mbps).\\n\\nGetting the newest firmware update didn't help in with any of these issues.\\n\\nOther Thoughts: The range isn't stellar either, but I knew that going into it. I ended up sending it back, and thankfully newegg refunded me so I could just spend a bit more and buy the archer that I should have went with in the first place. Don't buy this router to save a little cash, it isn't worth the hassle.\",\n",
       " 'Before I continue, ordered the Linksys AC900 and they sent me a Linksys AC1200. My friend ordered the same one (AC900) and also got the AC1200. So I’m not sure what happened but I’m definitely happy about it! The Linksys AC1200 is an excellent router for my apartment. I have a single story apartment/condo and this router connects several devices with no speed or connection issues (I have Xfinity with 50mbps download speeds). The Linksys app is great for managing passwords, devices, and some advanced admin tools. It’s so convenient to be able to go to the app and grab the password and send it to a guest via text message. Plus I can always monitor all the devices connected to the router and can block any device I want, or give them priority so more bandwidth goes to up to three devices, over any other device. I connect around 6 devices or more at a given time (2 iPhones, Apple TV, Nintendo Switch, Laptop, Baby monitor camera, etc) and they all work great. Our baby monitor camera only operates on a 2.4 Ghz connection and this router allows both 2.4 and 5 Ghz connections, with separate passwords and guest passwords. The only issue I’ve notice is when I play Rocket League on my laptop or Nintendo Switch, via a wireless connection I experience poor connection and “rubber banding”. I don’t think this router handles some games that require heavy duty connection. However, as soon as I plug in my laptop or Nintendo Switch via Ethernet cable, the router can handle the connection very well! I think it’s expected to use a wired connection for online gaming anyway, so this doesn’t diminish my experience with this router. Hopefully if you order this router, they’ll send you the AC1200 instead!',\n",

I did have trouble with setting them up as infrastructure printers but I think that turned out to be due to old drivers on the computers, one very declining-health inkjet (which is now dead), and incorrect \"wake on print job\" setting on a printer.

All devices at that location work satisfactorily though. I did put the D-link on top of a high cabinet though in hopes of eliminating some blocking from other network devices inside the cabinet.\\nLocation of the WPS button is easy to confuse with the RESET button. You must look closely at the tiny labels and I had to use a flashlight. They should have put the WPS button on the front/top or at least put large, contrasting labels on it.\\nThe D link is pretty big, check the dimensions, including antenna height, against your planned location before buying it.\\nOverall, these are minor complaints and I am satisfied with the D link for my \\'N\\' to \\'AC\\' upgrade.',\n",

       " 'I had to replace my DIR-655 because the old router (i.e. DIR-655) was unable to let me take full advantage of gigabit ethernet bandwidth coming out of my new DOCSYS 3.1 cable modem with Gbps service. My experience with DIR-882 has been mixed: wireless power and coverage: excellent; being able to handle bandwidth: very good. One critical (for me) function: inbound filter implementation: very poor, horrible, not really working. This review could be useful for you, three-star rating would apply to your situation only if you care about ibound filtering. If you don\\'t care about that function, stop reading. It could be a 5-start device for you. It\\'s relatively dirt-cheap. Now for the problem/issue: first of all, the older model, DIR-655, had a very good, though not perfect, implementation of inbound filters, which were possible to apply on port-by-port basis (think about virtual servers/port forwarding being configurable each with its own inbound filter). On DIR-882 inbound filters are global, they could not be applied on port-by-port basis. Also, while inbound filters work for BLOCKING specific groups of external IP addresses, they do NOT (seem) to work for ALLOWING *only* particular groups of external IP addresses to come through the router to LAN. It could be my stupidity, of course, that I was unable to configure the filters, I admit that there is a chance it\\'s my \"problem\" (hoping it\\'s the only one). I spoke with a D-LINK \"third-level\" technician who confirmed to me that inbound filters on DIR-882 do not work the way they did on DIR-655 (though she made an impression that she didn\\'t really know what DIR-665 (i.e. the older router) is capable of). In one sentence, I was unable to set up inbound filters (in combination with port forwarding) to allow incoming traffic only from certain IP addresses on certain TCP ports. Finally, DIR-882 does not allow to use inbound filters for remote management (you really don\\'t want remote management to be allowed from everywhere, if at all!). I am returning DIR-882 (no reason to bad-mouth D-LINK, I\\'ve been using a lot of their equipment for the past 20 years. Hoping that Netgear Nighthawk x10 will do what I want.

No response (at all!) from them concerning this matter for 5 days.\\n3) therefore, price-wise, D-Link seems to be superior\\n4) I have to move to a \"semi-professional\" router.\\n5) I never liked that these devices often combine more than one function (wireless and routing) - it\\'s just my personal choice (stupid? is as stupid does).\\n6) Both D-Link and Netgear devices have powerful wireless (but not as powerful as I wish they had, so it\\'s better for *me* to have my WAPs scattered around.

I have never owned a more disappointing, piece of garbage, feature-less router than Google WiFi. This past weekend was the last straw, so I decided to look elsewhere. Most of these mesh systems attempt to be very consumer friendly in that they only offer apps for management rather than a web admin page. I *need* a web admin page. I do port forwarding and use DHCP reservations, which are frustrating to do on an app, and I flat out hate using my phone to administer my router.\\n\\nMy house is 2350 sqft, and 2 stories. I was initially concerned that the D-Link AC2600 EXO (DIR-882) wouldn't cover my whole house and back yard, but those concerns were unfounded. I placed the router upstairs in the front of the house, and speed tests are still excellent in the backyard.\\n\\nThe web admin page is clean and uncluttered, and updating the router didn't wipe the settings, which may seem like an obvious feature, but tell that to TP-Link. The only thing that was difficult to find was where to do DHCP reservations (the home menu, click on the device list, then on a specific device). Everything else was pretty straightforward.\\n\\nI did turn off the smart connect feature (or whatever it's called) on the Wireless page, because my iPhone was connecting automatically to the 2.4 GHz network instead of the 5 GHz network. That might've been because of something I did on my Mac, though (changes sync across iCloud...yadda yadda), so possibly not the router's fault. Anyway, overall, I'm happy with this router so far.

Unless you have some EXTREME network requirements, going this way makes more sense.\\n\\nPros:\\nEasy Setup\\nThe Genie Android app for testing and managing. GET IT! The two best parts are the signal strength meter and the channel diagnostic. I was able to change the channel on my 2.4 band and improve it. I'm not a fan of the Auto channel setting. Had issues with it in the past. Maybe I am painting it with an old brush but I like choosing my own channels.\\nI am getting the same throughput on 5G wireless as I get hard wired.\\nI tested signal strength around the property. 2,500 sq. ft. house and 50x100 ft. yard. At the farthest point, with 3 walls and a metal garage door between me and the router, it dropped to 56% signal. No worries!\\nBeamforming+ really seems to work. We'll see over time but I'm getting amazing signal on stationary devices.\\n\\nCons:\\nAmazon lists the SHIPPING size NOT the router size on their site. The router is actually 191 x 198.5 x 65 mm (7.5 x 7.79 x 2.55 in). Amazon does this a LOT. I got pillows once in two huge boxes because of the finished size. They actually came compressed in shoe box size boxes and 4 of them would have fit in one of the AMZ shipping boxes. Sigh...\\nThe light-up NetGear logo on the front. I've even searched the interwebs... no way to turn it off. It is BRIGHT! So, keep that in mind. Put your router behind something or put black tape over the logo. It'll drive ya nuts if ya don't :O)\\n\\nIf I don't update this review it's because nothing changed. I'm pretty confident I won't have to.\",\n",
       " \"Ordered a refurbished unit and received the Charter Telecom version of the router instead of the vanilla Netgear. It is technically an R6300v2, but it has the Charter board ID and a blue band instead of the Netgear orange band. The router works, but the firmware is locked to Charter's latest published (old) firmware. It is possible to flash the latest Netgear firmware onto this board using the ddwrt initial flash first and then you can go to any firmware you would like. But, due to the Charter board ID, this is the process to go to any Netgear firmware...apply ddwrt initial, then the new Netgear firmware -- even after it's been flashed with vanilla Netgear firmware.\\n\\nThat aside, it is a decent router. I'm not using the wifi radios on it, only using as a router. Was running toastman Tomato on it, but was only able to get a max of about 245Mbps out of my cable provider. I have a 300Mbps+ circuit and with the vanilla Netgear firmware, I get up to about 345Mbps. The odd thing is the cpu and ram utilization were minimal, so it didn't seem to be a processing issue. So, for now, I'm back to the Netgear firmware.\\n\\nThe router is actually quite good for the refurb price of $45-ish, but knocking off a couple of stars for the reselling of Charter parts (especially without telling me first).\",\n",

Tried an old LinkSys router on this second connection and all was fine.\\n\\nCalled Netgear. The rep, who I had trouble understanding, had me reset the router. This caused my wi-fi connected printers to quit working which I had to reset. Periodic outages still occurred. Second rep, also difficult to understand, made several changes to the router parameters. No luck. The third rep I could barely understand, so I asked for a supervisor. He, at least I could understand, and concluded the router needed to be replaced. Each time I called I was subjected to a series of questions, the same questions. Even info I entered before talking to a rep (e.g. case number) had to be verbally given to the rep. Very tedious and made much worse by poor English skills.\\n\\nIf you buy this router, I hope you don't have to call support.\\n\\nUpdate Aug 10, 2017 - the replacement router had the same problem as the original. I'm pretty sure now that this is a firmware issue. Called support to register my continuing problem. I didn't want another replacement.

       " 'Once again bitten by the insufficient descriptions and specifications of Amazon. The title, description, and picture clearly indicate a R6300v2 original from Netgear. What I got instead was a build specific to a particular provider (Charter Communications) that simply is not as versatile and stable as the unbranded version. It identifies itself with a different board ID so putting an alternative firmware on it is a problem. Plain Kong DD-WRT may work, advanced tomato and similar will not - you need specially prepared firmware files for this. One quick way to identify the branded routers in a blue instead of a yellow band on the front while still stating R6300v2 on the bottom.\\n\\nUPDATE: I bought a second R6300v2 and once again: it was a Charter Communications device. If you are not an expert in technology DO NOT let any seller fool you into actually believing those two are indeed identical. Before applying any security updates, the manufacturer provided update process is checking an identifier in the router and Netgear is only providing those updates for their official products. The two routers may share the same hardware but the lack of manufacturer support for the Charter version is a a big minus, because it may leave your devices and network vulnerable to security exploits.\\n\\nOf course there is way to re-badge a Charter device back into a genuine Netgear device but this involves a firmware downgrade to the oldest available version, a special software called \"telnetEnabler\", and some command line instructions in order to burn the genuine Netgear board_id into the router. After completing this procedure, neither Netgear nor sources of alternative firmware (DD-WRT, Advanced Tomato, etc.) may tell a difference and their firmware/updates install smoothly.',\n",
       " 'Just like many other reviewers.....I purchased the router 05-01-2016. I just got off my 6th call with technical support since I purchased it 03-15-18. The first couple calls were smooth because it was under warranty. After warranty, NetGear then tries to charge me a \"support\" fee on every subsequent call, just as other have reviewed. They tried to justify it as costs on products, ect. The problem with this ideology is I have a washing machine, Epson printer/scan/fax, ect. All my products in my home....the manufacturer backs. Not only backs but when a hardware issue, software issue or patch comes out...they still help me configure my product! NOT NETGEAR!!!! They want to monetize off their patch update and then when the router does not work properly, they want to charge $136 to pay for support to \"reconfigure\" it. I can purchase a new router for the same cost! And just as other reviews have echoed...what router doesn\\'t last longer than 2 years and especially at this price point?!?! Also, it just shows NetGears greedy pig mentality to figure out how they can monetize off their customer while OTHER ROUTER VENDORS DO NOT DO THIS! PLEASE READ OTHER REVIEWS THAT ALL SAY THIS SAME THING!. Going to spend my $136 on a new router, from a different manufacturer, that backs their product configuration after normal warranty. What is the point of any electronic device that the manufacturer will not even help you configure to work properly without paying them? I mean...that\\'s just corporate greed at its finest. In fact, it left such a bad taste in my mouth....I will never buy another NetGear product again.

       " \"After extensive research and testing, the Trek N300 proved itself exceptionally strong.\\n\\nI had to research over 15 routers for my company. The requirements were unusual, but it gave me an opportunity to really compare everything from $19 routers up through $199.\\n\\nSummary:\\n- Signal strength in real world conditions was as strong as $199 high end routers (std dev = +/- 3%). As an FYI, almost all routers has signal strength within a typical margin of error of 5%\\n- N300 performance for basic file sharing was very slightly slower than high end routers up to about 12 clients, then file copy performance (1000K 4kb files + 5 5MB) dropped off after 12 clients. Its still performed within 10% of the high end routers, but it did begin to slow down a little. Considering the N300 is 15% the cost of the high end routers, this was incredible surprising. The N300 did an amazing job considering it was ~$29\\n- Overall performance of ALL the routers was commonly restricted by the client computers wireless card/chipset. Common laptops in the ~$800 range were usually the bottleneck, not the routers\\n- the N300 was absolutely the best performer in terms of its size. Nothing else even came close.\\n- File sharing on the device is a breeze (plug in the USB drive and you're pretty much ready to go)\\n- Ease of setup was great on this device. One of the easiest\\n\\nThat's about it. Great range, great performance, portability is unmatched, very easy to use.\\n\\nWe didn't need advanced features.

       " \"Product is well thought out and I love the versatility of powering it up through a USB port or using a wall plug. The various connection modes it offers are also quite handy. In the interest of full disclosure I have to state that I'm pretty tech savvy so I was prepared for the configuration and connection drop out problems some of the reviewers highlighted.\\n\\nAt home I have a cable modem offering four Ethernet ports, one of which is hard wired to a wireless router -- all wireless devices are connected to the router. The cable modem itself also offers its own WiFi network but up until I got the PR2000 I never bothered to use it as I didn't see any practical benefit.\\n\\nI tried out the PR2000 in both modes it offers:\\n- Turned it on in Wired mode after connecting an Ethernet cable from the cable modem to the WAN (blue) port on the back of the unit. Unit went online immediately and showed Internet connection with no manual intervention from me. I was able to connect to the SSID printed on the label and stay connected with no issues.\\n\\n- I then powered off the unit and placed it in a different room where I traditionally have had WiFi coverage issues when trying to connect to my wireless router. Turned the unit back on but now I selected wireless mode. I was able to log onto the internal web address printed on the label of the unit to create a new profile and use the unit in WiFi extender mode. Setup is quick via the NetGear Genie web interface and unit connected and allowed me to surf the web after the 2 min it takes to reconfigure itself. However, the connection seems to consistently drop every 3-5 min. Resetting the connection requires logging back into the NetGear Genie web interface and going through the process again so highly annoying, to say the least (my wife had a few choice words to say on the matter... :) ). After some research I found a post in a forum that seems to indicate that DHCP has to be disabled in the LAN zone and static IP addresses have to be assigned to clients connected to the unit, e.g. laptops. Before I did that, though, I decided to join the the WIFi network broadcasted by the cable modem. Once I did that I repeated the procedure to connect and the connection has been rock solid ever since. The difference between the two WiFi networks is that the cable modem supports both IPv4 and IPv6 type addressing whereas my router supports only IPv4. In addition, the cable modem assigns a 10.0.0.x address whereas the router assigned the more typical 192.168.1.xx range.\\n\\nI can see how some of the reviewers got frustrated and decided to return the unit -- the networking knowledge I had to draw from to resolve the connection dropping out issue far exceeds what can reasonably be expected from the average consumer. And it goes without saying that without a laptop to wire into the unit to complete the configuration I would NOT have been successful to get this to work as intended. I noticed that some reviewers may not own/have access to a laptop so that becomes a showstopper.\\n\\nAll that being said I am ordering a second unit as for the price you can't beat the feature set this unit offers. However, the prospective buyer is forewarned that he/she should be willing to tinker with the unit especially if you're planning to use it as a WiFi extender.\",\n",

I now carry it with me anywhere I travel, and it's proven to be very useful at meetings where others have not been able to use an otherwise spotty WiFi signal. It also provides an additional layer of protection when using a public or semi-private WiFi signal. (It won't keep people from getting data you send over a non-secure network, but it can help keep them from seeing and getting into your computer when connected to that network.) Love this device!

So by being logged onto my Netgrear router, it finds the available wifi services and their strength and allows me to login to them with a single device, for all of my devices logged onto the router. Typically I will check into a hotel and have my laptop, smart phone and Roku connected to the router, so when I log on with my smart phone, the other devices are automatically logged on when they are started up. It also provides a fire wall, and the wifi service does not know how many devices I have connected, since it is all handled by the Netgear router.

You plug it into the wall (at hotels, plug it in closest to your door, since hotels routers are either in their lobby, or they have bridges/extenders on every floor for better connection for it's patrons), and switch the power from Off to Wireless. It will light up, then find and connect itself to the hotels connection. After that, you go to www.routerlogin.net, click on your hotel's Wi-Fi, type in any password if it's necessary, and that's it. Your connected to the internet, across multiple devices. Just log in to your Netgear SSID on whatever device you want to use (It will be called NETGEAR50), and it will connect wirelessly. Occasionally, the hotel's Wi-Fi connection page will pop up right after, but just click connect, and you will still be on your secured (with WPA, WPA2) Netgear Wi-Fi network.\\n\\nIt also extends the signal throughout your room, so even if the hotel's Wi-Fi is weak, as long as your able to plug your Netgear Travel Router in by the door, or anywhere closest to the hotel's router, you can connect multiple devices on a strong signal (strong enough for Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon Cloud, etc. to sync on multiple devices).\\n\\nIt does several other things, but I haven't found the need to use them. It has a USB port (that DOES NOT charge, BTW) to sync and share media wirelessly over all of your connected devices. You just plug in whatever it is (your ipod, external hard drive, etc) and you can watch or listen to whatever is on your Ipod/hard drive on any of your devices that are on your Netgear SSID.\\n\\nIt's very simple to use, has worked flawlessly in dozens of different hotels, and 300mbps is plenty fast, my Dropbox/Clouds sync within a matter of minutes. It comes with a very thorough user manual, so any questions you do have will most likely be answered in the manual. I would recommend this over any of the other travel routers within the same price range ($20 - $40), even those from reputable companies. After testing 5 different ones, this one came out on top in multiple areas and gives me a secure connection every time. I am able to run two laptops, my phone, and my Kindle Fire on the secure SSID it creates, and have had no performance issues so far.

Since the Roku 3 is not a web browser, the terms acceptance is what has always prevented me from using it.\\n\\nThe NETGEAR Trek N300 solves that problem. With it, you first establish a connection with the NETGEAR device through your PC's browser, then establish your connection with the hotel WiFi, then accept the hotel's terms as normal.\\n\\nOnce the NETGEAR device is connected to the hotel's WiFi, it becomes your personal hotspot through which you can connect your Roku 3, wireless PC, smartphone... whatever, just as if you are back home on your own home network.

This Netgear is more boxy than the rounded Airport Express. Also, the picture with the hand holding it made it look smaller than it actually is.\\n\\nFirst, some advantages over the Airport Express. This Netgear can be powered via USB, which can be convenient during travel. Also, it has two ethernet ports (vs only one on the previous gen Airport Express), and the WAN ethernet port can become a LAN port, depending on the setup. iOS app is decent, and has a great feature in monitoring bandwidth usage. Really flexible setup, and can be used to share an existing wireless connection to wireless.\\n\\nMinuses: it supports only 2.4GHz 802.11n. No 5GHz. No gigabit ethernet. Power slider is tiny can can be switched accidentally. Also, I find that the unit can get confused if I switch from wired to wireless mode (and vice versa) without turning it off first (the Airport Express doesn't even have a power switch). I am used to the Apple Airport Express setup, thus setting up this Netgear via a browser is really confusing at first. Device can be unstable at times. Connectivity is usually great, but there are random times where my wifi devices suddenly can't recognize the router momentarily.\\n\\nI think Apple's Airport Express is still the gold standard, but it is unfortunate that Apple decided to go with a different design on the latest one.

The experiment had an ideal situation, with the WF2419 sitting approximately 6 inches away from my main router.\\n\\nWhen it worked, it was fine. Web browsing seemed quick enough.

I gave this brand a try, and so far this thing works way better, and it is also much cheaper to top it off. I just use it as an access point which is plugged into an ethernet cable where I have bad wifi coverage, in order to add some wifi coverage in my house, using a different SSID in that area. This is a better way of doing it versus setting it up as a wifi repeater, because the speed is faster when it is connected to a cable, versus connecting it wirelessly to a different wifi access point. The only con with this device is the instructions that came with it are extremely basic, so there is a certain amount of playing around with settings. But the web admin page is pretty much self explanatory and this is is no easier or harder to set up than any other competing brand of access point. If you\\'ve done it before, you can do it again. Strangely, if you just buy an \"access point\" product, you\\'d typically pay about $100 for the product. This item has that feature built in, just select bridge mode instead of router mode, and tell it to use the antenna as an access point and you have the same thing. As an added benefit, it has a little 4 port 10/100 Mb switch on it. Which is an odd speed, being that its wireless supports 300 Mb. I understand this items comes in a different version with a gigabit speed switch on it, if that is of any concern. As my internet is slower than 100 Mb, this is obviously of no concern to me at this price point.',\n",

If it was not already obvious, the item I received was most certainly not the 'new' item that I had ordered, and was mostly likely a refurbished unit. Anyways, upon inserting my T-Mobile sim card into the M1, I powered on the device and was able to connect to T-Mobile towers, which fixed the issue I had experienced with the general unlocked model of the M1. Upon connecting to the internet however, I found that speeds were incredibly sluggish and did not work as they should have, especially compared to the older model of LTE router I was aiming to replace, the Netgear LB1120 which was achieving faster speeds and a more reliable connection in the same physical location.

Windows XP, vista, and Windows 7, work just fine right out of the box.\\n\\nI pay for this router $45 in Dec 2007 so the $64 they asking now seems expensive more so if you realize that most Wireless-N Routers sell now for $60. Unless you have really old laptop or PC I recommend you get latest Wireless-N technology (chances are that you going to upgrade anyway in the next year or so since Windows 7 is coming out strong).\\n\\nSome Wireless-N Routers do have legacy support so look into the specs before you make the purchase to find out if that specific model will support your hardware(some models have Wireless-a, b, G, and N)',\n",
       " \"If you're buying this product and operate on a Mac platform, ditch the CD and go directly to live assistance on the Linksys website.\\n\\nI recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself. I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison. (The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)\\n\\nHOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup. I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support. But when I opened the box I found little more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed CD before plugging in the router.\\n\\nToo bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac. (Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips. I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless. The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac. It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something. But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS), where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it. I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if someone would just give me some instructions in plain English.\\n\\nThe router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant. What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance. I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable. But the product iself is great.\\n\\nIf you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product. Once you set it up, it's great. And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting. Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.\",\n",

Whether it is a computer, a handheld organizer, or a video game system like the Xbox 360 or Nintendo Wii. It is very convient because DSL and broadband internet are now becoming musts in the average home in convient service packages from phone and cable companies. Unfortunately, most of them don't seem to include routers with the service. They do include cable and DSL modems that work nicely, but a lot of us just want more for the net. Linksys knows, as one of the best companies that makes it convient for subscribers, and here is why.\\n\\nLinksys WRT54G Wireless G Router, is a simple and convient router that works very well with computers through either a wired connection, or through a wireless card sold seperately in the stores. The setup is very easy to use, but it connects through an ethernet cable rather than a USB cable. That might be unfortunate for some who have a laptop computer, because they would need the wireless card. The router also works very well with video game systems like the Nintendo Wii or the Xbox 360 through the Wi-Fi antenna. The router also includes Norton's Internet Security software as a 60 day trial offer. It works mostly well, but it takes awhile to setup the software.\\n\\nAlthough there are other routers that might work well, Linksys is one of the best brands on the market for anybody who needs a little add-on to their wireless network whether it is in the office, or extra internet ready devices.

This is my first time entering the \"wireless world\" and had been really nervous about how all this was going to work. But this router comes with a CD that makes it SO easy, step by step, that a total newbie like me had it working in no time!\\n\\nOn top of that, the Linksys tech support people are great. You\\'re saying, she needed tech support already? How good can this router be, after all. But the thing is, it\\'s highly likely you\\'ll need just a smidge of assistance in the \"configuring the router\" step after you\\'ve installed it. You call your ISP people, get the appropriate info from them, do that little step. Then call the Linksys folks, a few things to enter in and click on and presto! You\\'ve got wireless!! I love these guys!\\n\\nA couple helpful hints, though, to other wireless newbies which I learned the hard way, of course. Locate your router as far away from things like cordless phones and other sources of radio frequency \"noise\" or interference as possible.\\n\\nAlso, as a computer genius friend of mine explained, keep in mind that the wireless router broadcasts omnidirectionally...in all directions. So, try also to position your new router someplace away from an exterior wall or a window (you don\\'t want the bulk of your signal going \"out the window\"). And do try to located it as closely as you can to where you plan to use your wireless computer (remember that signals degrade with distance)with as few solid things between it and your wireless computer as possible.\\n\\nAs far as operating systems and the Linksys router goes, it\\'s not real happy with Win ME but it loves Win XP. My PC with Win ME wasn\\'t able to configure the router. But once my friend suggested I configure it via my laptop with the Win XP (which is what I planned to use wirelessly anyway), all systems were a definite, easy and fast GO.\\n\\nThe Amazon price for this new Linksys router was significantly lower than other places, it shipped quickly and has been an overall positive experience.

       " \"I ordered this router through Amazon, along with its sister PCMCIA card for my Gateway Solo laptop. My goal was merely to broadcast the Comcast Digital Cable access throughout my 2,000 square feet home at the faster 802.11g speed. I wanted to surf the Web from the comfy couch in the TV room or a cozy chair in the living room...my choice -- no wires involved. I have never installed a network, so a lot of the literature, reviews on Amazon, and other sources of information were lost on me: I simply went with the big name brand at a reasonable price.\\nI installed the router in about 20 minutes using the accompanying CD. Lights were flashing, and the hard connection to my laptop recognized the router. Flipped up the 5 inch rabbit ears and seemed to be in business. All-in-all pretty seamless. I had high hopes that I'd be wirelessly surfing soon. This was pretty exciting to me, as I am still running on Windows 98SE, and worried that I might encounter difficulties.\\nThe installation of the sister WPC54G PCMCIA card didn't go so well. Again, I ran it instruction-by-instruction from the installation CD, and while the Linksys software seemed to install OK, the procedure tripped up when attempting to install a program called 'Odyssey' from a firm called Funk Software, Inc. The program kept looking for drivers, requesting that I insert the Microsoft Windows 98SE disk in my drive. I don't have a Microsoft disk, but a Gateway OEM version that apparently has Microsoft Windows 98SE, but not the specific drivers that Odyssey needs. To sum up, I spent several hours, all told, surfing Microsoft, Linksys, and Funk Software knowledgebase pages, downloading stuff, booting and rebooting my laptop, before giving up and going to bed frustrated. Tried again in the morning, and somehow, I still don't know how, hit the right combination of set up protocols that suddenly energized the PCMCIA card. I went from zero to eighty in no time, and my profanities turned to whoops of joy.\\nThe best online help came from Funk Software, where I found a customer service technician at the help desk who answered my emails. His solution: as I was running a simple home office network (not a corporate enterprise solution) and I didn't employ a RADIUS server (whatever that is?) I shouldn't need Odyssey, so gave me good instructions on how to eradicate it from my PC. Still not entirely sure what Odyssey purports to do, so perhaps I'm missing some benefit?\\nNonetheless, the router and card in my laptop are communicating nicely throughout the house...no connections further than 3 walls and 150 feet. Speed is excellent. I stepped through the setup of what I suppose is a rudimentary firewall (clicked a box marked 'Firewall enabled') and turned on WEP 128. I hope to figure out WPA next, and I hope that Odyssey is not part of this set up, but in the final analysis I am pleased with the product, happy I didn't have to pay a consultant, and sending this report to Amazon wirelessly from my comfy chair!\\nExperience of user: None.\\nTotal install time: 5 hours\\nBiggest problem: Firmware for WPC54G card missing drivers\",\n",

The 8200 is so hideous that for the look alone I decided to return that. The motorola still probably wins the look (it's your personal choice). But given how big Motorola modems are, I would rather have this cute little modem. Speaking of which, the modem is really tiny (roughly same size as 8200 and actually a tad bit shorter and thinner).\\n3. Unlike 8200, 8600 and 8611, S33 actually forced me to call Xfinity to activate (the other modems activated without hassle via the xfinity app).\\n\\nFew observation about firmware compared to Motorola MB 8611 and Arris 8200:\\n\\n1. Unlike Arris 8200, there is no spectrum analyzer on S33! At least I cannot access 192.168.100.1:8080\\n2. For me on S33 the SNR/MER is more or less same on all channels as MB 8611, except the OFDM PLC is showing 1 dB less than 8611 (may be it will get better as the modem locks in better).\\n3. The Power shifted by full -5 dBmV. While most of my channels on MB 8611 had 8 dBmV (except OFDM PLC which had -2 dBmV), the S33 is showing around 3 dBmV for all but OFDM PLC and on OFDM PLC it's showing -5 dBmV. So, the entire signal level shifted by -5 (and OFDM shifted by -3).\\n4. Upstream power level seems to be more or less same on both S33 and 8611.\\n\\nI just installed the modem. So, will have to test few days and observe Corrected and Uncorrectables before I report on those. On 8611 I used to accumulate low single digit corrected and Uncorrectable was very rare (less than 1 a day).\",\n",

My ISP is only able to offer me a maximum 7Mbps connection where I live out in the sticks, so my impression of the speed improvement that I've experience after upgrading to this router would be almost entirely through the addition of the dual band function that this one gives me. What I am impressed with, are all the options that this router offers. I have a removable hard drive connected to the USB that gives me access to the drive anywhere in the house, without having to go find it and plug it in. Plus, with two computers, now the files can be shared. Access to the removable storage can be password protected, so you aren't giving access to your personal stuff to friends and family when you want to give them access to the WiFi. You can set-up a guest account, with a password or not, to give people access to your WiFi without having to give out your own password.

It's nice to have the 5 Ghz option if you live in a crowded area with a lot of wifi access points. Most people use 2.4 Ghz as their devices are mostly not 5 Ghz compatible. So, the caveat is that your devices need to be able to use the 5 Ghz range as well to take full advantage of the device's capability. It does have a USB port to attach a storage device. You will find the transfer speeds slow when copying data over a typical wireless network. So, this feature is acceptable for access to documents etc. in a home network.

However, the 5 GHz band was interfering with certain channels on the TV. How do I know this? Because I tuned in to one of those channels during the interference and turned off the router.

The device runs both 5 Ghz and 2.4 GHz access points simultaneously, but they are separate. In other words, you have to decide which access point to use for each device. Use 5 GHz unless it causes trouble. Devices on the two different access points are still on the same network. 2. The device has a guest network too. This is separate from the main network. However, anyone connected to the guest network still has access to your internet connection. In other words, be sure to have a fairly secure password for your guest account too.\\n\\nUpdate 11/24/2107. We bought this in March 2015.

       " \"I have no choice but to give this product a 1-star rating. The router I received simply did not work correctly. I bought this router to replace an ancient Linksys WRT54G (version 2) router. The old Linksys has always served me well, but since my ISP upped my internet speeds a few weeks ago, it isn't fast enough anymore to support it. Since I'm missing out on my new internet speed I decided to upgrade the router. I did a lot of research, and decided to go with the WD My Net N600 HD. It has gotten good reviews, and I like the dual-band features of it.\\n\\nOkay, so the router looks really nice. One thing you'll notice when you unpack it is the lack of external antenna's and the fact the device is surprisingly light weight. Almost too light. The indicator lights next to every WAN-port are a nice little extra feature too.\\nOne fired up and logged in with an internet browser the GUI is very nice and easy to use. So far the good.\\n\\nHere is the bad, and the reason for me returning this product and leaving a bad score:\\nNo device on my network could get any higher speeds then 72.2mbps. It almost looks like this router is locked and won't support any higher, though it should. I tried different security settings, different channels, set it from 20mhz channel width to 20-40 (auto), but to no avail. I cannot get 2.4GHZ device to connect at 150mbps. The signal strength was excellent, and I have no problems getting 150 mbps on any other N network. I only have one wireless signal in my area (I live out in the country) and that particular signal is on channel 1. I had the WD My Net N600 set to channel 6. There was absolutely no interference, yet I could not get any higher speeds then 72.2mpbs. I even turned of 5GHZ and security for testing purposes, but I couldn't win. It stayed stuck at 72.2mbps.\\n\\nThat was pretty disappointing, but even worse was the fact the router would drop my internet connection for about 10 seconds every 5 minutes. I upgraded the firmware, checked all the settings, but again: After a couple of frustrating hours I was unable to come up with a solution.\\n\\nNeedless to say I hooked up my ancient 12-year old - but rock solid - Linksys WRT54g again. Even though I am missing out on my improved internet speed of 30MBPS (which 54g is incapable of delivering, regardless of it being a 54mbps connection), at least with this old thing I have a stable connection again.\\n\\nI will be looking for another router again. If this WD My Net N600 would work as promised it would've been aan awesome little device: As it stands though, it seems to be a bit of a hit-and-miss. I personally will not try another WD router again.\",\n",

Not so. The box itself is attractive and fits neatly on a desk, but the wireless signal is weak and the response of the unit somewhat slow.\\n\\nThe first unit I bought began to fail intermittently after about a year. I bought another to replace it and it bricked immediately upon installing a firmware upgrade (which I was hoping might solve the performance problems with the earlier unit).

Use the wizard and all to get the router set up for the home network (don\\'t be lazy and use your wireless card to setup the router, use a LAN cable and you can save yourself the heartache later if you mess up the firmware update.)\\n\\n2. Go to the Linksys website and download and install the latest firmware.\\n\\n3. go to Linksys website and click to Support > Technical support > Easy connect > Router\\'s initial setup. This will run a program called \"Netset.\" Follow the instructions - If you want an encrypted wireless network, NOW through Netset is the easiest time to do it. Follow all the instructions.\\n\\n4. With Netset, you will have the option of creating a network disk. Don\\'t try and set up each computer separately; you\\'ll always mess something up doing it manually, get a USD drive, or floppy and make a network disk, this will help make sure every computer is on the same workgroup and there will be no communication problems (for example all your computers can connect to the internet, but they can\\'t \"see\" each other on the network for file sharing or printing).\\n\\n5. with the firmware updated, network configured, all options set, and computers configured. Turn all the computers, router and Cable/DSL modem off, wait 20 sec. and then turn modem on, then router, then computers. And your network should be working flawlessly. If not, redo steps 3-5, and double check to make sure all the drivers for your wireless network adapters on all the computers are up to date. Also sometimes after a day or so, something fishy will start acting up on the network. Just run \"NetSet\" one more time and you should have all the bugs worked out. This happened to me once but I haven\\'t had to reconfigure anything since.\\n\\nNOTE TO BUYER: If you want to extend your range with the external antenna don\\'t waste your money on an official Linksys \"better then generic\" antenna, go to RadioShack or Amazon and buy the $19 antenna for wireless-G routers, it connects perfectly to your WRT54GC. As far as the distance without the antenna, it is quite remarkable for an internal; I got good range even without the external.\\n\\nThere have been a few people complain about a router that is \"dead\" the next day. Ah, the wonderful world of mass production. It is true that every now and then you get a dud, that\\'s life now with the fast paced world of technology. Just send it back and get a new one, there is nothing wrong with the correctly built router.\\n\\nAll in all I have no complaints after the hair-pulling installation.',\n",
       " \"This one survived an ant invasion! I had this dangling down behind my computer desk, and apparently it was close to the wall and baseboard, because a colony of ants took up housekeeping - queen and all with eggs - inside the unit. I had it down there to minimize the SSID broadcast because the firmware doesn't allow turning off the radio. After a year or so, the signal quality was lower than expected, then it just disappeared from the laptop in the next room. Everything else worked, just no radio. So I pulled out the equipment to get to the router and was dumbstruck by the ants. They were everywhere - mostly going in and out of the router. I sprayed the heck out of everything including the router, disconnected the router and put it in my pile to go to e-waste collection day. I was curious what it looked like inside, so I separated the snap-together shell with a cellphone/ipod repair device and was astounded how many dead ants were trapped inside. The thing was solid with ants, apparently attracted to the warmth of the unit. I washed everything down gently with dish soap and water, followed by circuit board and contact cleaner, then set it aside to dry. Put it back together, and it worked as the day it was new. I am sold on Linksys. This is the only GC (compact) model I own, and I use it to provide an open wi-fi hotspot at my home when someone visits who needs an open hotspot. I unplug it afterward.

Likewise I figured I didn't need a fancy router either. I didn't read the fine print close enough and didn't realize the max speed on this thing is 100 Mbps.\\n\\nSo, the way router classifications are supposed to work is the AC in the model means this router will do 802.11ac, and the 1200 part is supposed to mean the max speed that the router will do. This number isn't regulated though so each company will do creative math of adding random things together to get the biggest number possible. I figured 1200 is bigger than my ISP's 200, I'm good. Nope.\\n\\nThe wired ethernet connection from the modem to the router has a maximum speed of only 100 Mbps. So no matter how fast the wireless is or how fast your devices connected to the router are, it all has to funnel through this tiny 100 Mbps pinhole. It really should be called the RT AC-100. Don't even get me started about how my wifi devices kept disconnecting after about 24 hours and I would have to reboot the router to get them to connect again.\\n\\nAfter fiddling with this thing for 2 weeks trying to get it to work I gave up and contacted Amazon to see if they had any ideas. They put me in contact with Asus and they had me do some speed tests. Computer wired directly to the modem was 236 Mbps. Same computer with the same ethernet cable connected to this router was 94 Mbps. Then they had me test the 5 Ghz ac wifi. The speed test takes about 10 seconds and for the first 8 seconds this router was struggling to even make it to 1.5 Mbps, and towards the end the router finally woke up a little and got it up to 16 Mbps. That's when the Asus guy agreed with me that I needed to return the router to Amazon.\\n\\nEven if you're just buying this router for your grandma who checks her email once a month and manages to forget her password every single time and get 15 viruses, get something better!\\n\\nThe TP-Link AC1200 router is $10 less than this Asus router and it supports gigabit ethernet. I've never tried it myself but if you need a cheap router you should probably go with that instead. Asus routers are good though, and Asus is a good company. They just cut too many corners on this router.\\n\\nI returned this one and paid $15 more to get the Asus RT AC1900 which also confusingly has the model number RT-AC68U, but it's the same thing. I've had it for almost two weeks now and I couldn't be happier. My wireless devices have all stayed connected since I got it, and I haven't had to reboot it a single time so far. I can access the full speed of my modem through it, and tons of other great features.\\n\\nAmazon gets 5 stars for being so helpful though, and giving me a free return. I didn't have to print a label. I didn't have to pay any shipping. They returned the full amount, and got me the router upgrade with free shipping in just a few days. Hopefully this review will help someone.\",\n",

I found this 1200 series Asus for just $12 open box (and they have a LOT of returned units here!) and I'm super happy with it.\\n\\nWe don't have the fastest internet speed (like 25mb), so it's nice to have multiple wifi networks that I can throttle - one for my family (8mb), one for guests (5mb), and then the main 5G signal I use for work in case I need a fast connection for meetings and such. And then I use the QOS feature to super throttle our kids tablets down to like 4mb because...well they don't need their videos to load in HD quality and RIGHT NOW...they can wait haha!\\n\\nApparently the #1 complaint with Amazon user reviews is that the main LAN in/out master port is only 10/100 speed, not gigabit. For anyone that has less than 100mb connection, it doesn't matter. I dunno about everyone else, but the fastest line we have (even at my work place) is only 30mb. The connection at our cottage is only like 25mb.\\n\\nBut there are always going to be speed-junkies who look at pure numbers. This isn't the router for you if you want that pure speed.\\n\\nBut again - $12 - what do you expect? Even at its new $45 price tag, this Asus has SO many features. QOS, up to 6 guest networks (3x 2.4g and 3x 5g), and decent enough wifi strength. We have a 1500SF main level home and it reaches to all the corners of the house and basement without issue - in the FARTHEST part of the basement sometimes it gets down to 1 bar, but we don't need the nets there...so...\\n\\nAnyway - it's a solid wifi router for basic home needs under 100mb connections.

By doing so I put my network at risk but at least I could use it.\\n\\nThen my son complained that his PlayStation could no longer connect to the internet. In order to get this to work I, yet again, had to compromise another malfunctioning security feature and turn off NAT Filtering and make it wide open.

The routers scan everything coming and going to every device across the Intranet and Internet.\\nThis way we can safely access anything from one place anywhere on the ranch, without sharing computers, scanners and printers. Just like the servers in a large office building but across our ranch! That also means that if a computer crashes, all we do is plug in a new one, point it to the NAS and it’s up and running.\\nOur download and upload speeds on our network are as fast on the far edge of the ranch, as they are at the main router, with zero lost packets, and this WavLink AC1200 fits right in.\\nIn English, our network is as fast at the beginning as it is at the end and nothing is lost along the line including at the end of this WavLink AC1200. The Internet connection speeds and data transfer rates that we see on the main router are identical to the speeds at the farthest access points connected devices.\\nGood Luck, we’re very happy with our WavLink AC1200 and I think you will be too.',\n",

       " 'This is the first \"smart plug\" device I have purchased. We have several switches on timers and an older automated lighting system in the house, but I wanted to control some string lights in the porch and since there wasn\\'t an outlet there we looked for alternatives. Initially we had tried one of those inexpensive remote control outlets. It worked OK for a while, but at times the remote would be unresponsive. At other times the lights would come on or shut off by themselves. We started wondering if perhaps a neighbor had the same type of switch and our signals were interfering.\\n\\nEnter the TP-Link Smart Plug. This is ideal because it only covers one of the receptacles which allows us to continue using the other one. We utilize a few of the Amazon Echo devices in the house so integrating with Alexa was a must. I have a few other TP-Link devices in my home and have been pleased with them, so I figured I\\'d give this a shot and I\\'ve been very happy.\\n\\nSetup was easy. I downloaded the Kasa app on my phone, walked through the simple instructions, linked it to Alexa via the Echo app... and done. Setup took maybe three minutes and it worked perfectly the first time and every time since. There are no batteries needed, and no other devices (hubs or other hardware) so all you need is the one Smart Plug, a smartphone or tablet, and wifi. In fact even if you didn\\'t have wifi you could still control this from a smartphone but you would have to connect to the wifi in the plug itself.\\n\\nNow we can simply ask Alexa to turn the lights on or off and the response time is practically instantaneous. I thought there might be a lag of a second or two when using Alexa but that hasn\\'t been the case. I can also use my phone to turn the lights on or off (or any device where you have the app installed), or I can set different timers or various scenes if I really want to. However, for our purposes a simple on or off is all we need.\\n\\nAlso, the unit does have a button on the side so you can turn the lights on or off manually - but we have the plug buried behind a cabinet so we won\\'t be using that feature. This is really about as simple as automated lighting can get. I\\'m very happy and eventually I can see installing some of the hard wired switches in various rooms to allow us even more control over lighting and the ability to ask Alexa to shut off the lights downstairs since asking the kids doesn\\'t seem to work nearly as well.\\n\\nBased upon my experience I\\'ll most likely continue going back to TP-Link for our other smart devices since the app is so easy to use and having multiple devices together in one app allows custom scenes and things like vacation mode etc.\\n\\nThe only minor (and I do mean minor) negative I can think of is that as of now I do not believe there is a way to dim the lights controlled by the switch. I somewhat understand that since TP-Link has no idea what kind of devices people might plug into it and therefore they wouldn\\'t want people dimming power to devices that could be harmed by this. However there might be times when having the lights on at only half power would be nice, so just be aware that as of today this is a strictly on or off plug. They could change this down the road with a firmware update perhaps, but I\\'m not expecting that to happen. If you want to dim your lights, you\\'ll likely need to invest in one of the hard wired switches that offers that functionality.',\n",

       " 'After researching automated light switches and outlets to control my lights, I picked TP-Link because they do not require a separate hub to work.

The online TP-LINK installation videos are awesome; short and concise with clear instructions. These Smart devices work perfectly every time using the Kasa app, Alexa and now the Google Assistant. When the power went out once, the devices automatically reconnected and worked flawlessly. BEST PURCHASE EVER!!!\\n\\nI bought the Amazon Echo Dot - 4 times - and controlled my lights from anywhere in the house simply by speaking to Alexa.\\n\\nThen, as of 3/25/17, Google Assistant got in the action. So now I can also tell my phone \"Ok Goggle, turn on the Basement\" and the two Smart Plugs (one mini and one original-sized) turn on together since I made a \"basement\" group to include them both.\\n\\nIf you\\'re buying these Smart Plugs or Smart Switches for the first time, the below info will be helpful to know to avoid asking yourself \"why is it not working for me the way people say they do?\"\\n\\n1. You need to install the Kasa app and create a user account to operate your devices using your phone/tablet. The Smart devices must be able to connect via the WiFi in your house to be operated remotely (by you not manually touching the device). Although you can still operate the devices manually, you bought these to operate them remotely. The Kasa app let\\'s you name each Smart device (IMPORTANT: NAME EACH DEVICE AND GROUP AS YOU WANT TO CALL IT OUT USING ALEXA OR GOOGLE ASSISTANT) and create \"Scenes\" to group multiple Smart devices to turn on/off at the same time. Tapping on the device name in the Kasa app opens the options to set schedules, timers and more.\\n\\n2. Got an Amazon Echo? Install the Alexa app on your phone/tablet, add the Kasa Skill, link the Kasa Skill to your Kasa account (from point #1 above), discover devices, then create Groups - similar to the Scenes in Kasa - and select which devices to include in the group for Alexa to know what you meant to turn on/off at the same time. If you DON\\'T create groups in the Alexa Skill: A) Simply ask Alexa to turn on/off the individual Smart device name, and... B) Alexa will NOT know which multiple Smart devices to turn on/off at the same time - even though you created a Scene (group) in the Kasa app, key phrase here... \"in the Kasa app\". After you create a group name and include Smart devices in the Alexa Skill, you\\'ll feel like one of The Jetsons, a Star Trek crew member or a millionaire, with the power to command lights on and off using you voice: \"Alexa, turn on the Living Room\".\\n\\n3. Got an Android smartphone/tablet with Android version 6.0 or higher? Google began sending upgrades to those devices to install the Android Assistant - the same Artificial Intelligence (AI) used with the Google Home device (the device that competes with Amazon Echo). Here\\'s the deal, similar to the Alexa Skill, you NEED to enable and setup the Android Assistant using the similar steps I described in topic #2 above: Link it to your Kasa account, create Group names and add Smart devices to the group, etc. To set up your Android Assistant to operate your TP-LINK Smart devices, start by saying \"Ok Google, turn on my LIGHTS\" - the AI is smart and will prompt you with a bubble for you to setup Google Home interfaces. It\\'s da bomb!\\n\\nHopefully this will help you enjoy your TP-LINK Smart devices as much as I do.\\n\\nIf you\\'re thinking \"I\\'m still not sure if I should get these or another brand...\" GET THESE!!! You will not regret it. They work great! Also, when I had questions, their customer support was very responsive.

Ultimately, it comes down to what your expectations are for a $40 WiFi 6 router.\\n\\nFirst, the setup was simple and easy. Unlink more expensive routers and home networking kits, there are no apps associated with this router. You simply go to cudy dot net to set it up, and it was so quick and easy, it literally took me less than two minutes to set up both my 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz connections. After that, and as of this review it's been more than three weeks, and there has not yet been a disconnection. There was one time a slow down during peak dinner time where one of my TVs had a slow connection issue with YouTube, but my other TV and phones were fine. I have Spectrum 100mbs service, and I actually get 15-20% more on the Speedtest, as you can see in one of the photos. This is not because of the router, as my other two routers had the same numbers. Of note is the T-Mobile 5G speed from my Samsung Note 20 Ultra which is an insane 370mbs in Honolulu. Even my iPhone 12 Pro Max at the same time only pulled around 55mbs.\\n\\nThe bottom line is this router is now less than $40 (the value was $70 when I requested it for review), so at this price, you get an excellent router to future-proof for the next decade perhaps, and if you have a simple setup like me, then you don't really need anymore than this, unless you're a streamer/gamer and need the best of the best with those $300 gaming routers. BTW, my household has two TVs, one laptop, one iPad Pro, and four smartphones, as well as a WiFi printer, PS5, so at its peak, it's distributing to almost 10 devices concurrently. Not bad for a cheap Chinese router.\\n\\nFYI - the connection strength is not as good as my $80 WiFi 6 TP-Link, but is better than my AC Google WiFi. And not as strong as my older but more expensive gaming routers such as the Asus RT-AC3200, Netgear Nighthawks, and the TP-Link AC5400.

       " \"I needed a router that was confirmed to run Openwrt so I jumped on the opportunity to test the Cudy WiFi 6 Router AX1800 Smart WiFi Router.\\n\\nAt AX1800, this router really isn't much of an upgrade from the AC1750 Archer C7 that I had previously so in terms of WIFI performance, it wasn't much of an upgrade despite it being Wifi 6.\\n\\nFor me, the important factor here is the Openwrt firmware. The default firmware that is installed on the X6 router seems to be a custom skin for LUCI (verified by the URL of /cgi-bin/luci in the browser), but many features are missing in the UI, including the ability to enable ssh, so one of my first actions was to download the Openwrt Firmware from Cudy's website. The following is what I found:\\n\\nUsing the Archer C7 as my main router, I was able to put together a WIFI mesh with fast switching with Openwrt's 802.11r and 802.11s support. I was hoping that I can extend that mesh with the Cudy X6. What I discovered of the Openwrt firmware is that it is a custom compile of the 20.2 branch and therefore, not quite a stable release. After installing the wpad packages to allow 802.11s and WPA3, the wireless drivers didn't work correctly. Without going into too much detail, I believe that the drivers for the Wifi 6 adapter needs some work.\\n\\nHopefully, Cudy continues to work on the firmware and incorporate their changes into the official Openwrt repo. Once these problems are ironed out, it be a good replacement for the Archer C7 but even then, don't expect AX1800 to be a revolutionary step up from your current 802.11a wifi. This is the lowest Wifi 6 level that one can purchase.\",\n",
       " 'This router Cudy WiFi 6 AX1800 is a budget WiFi 6 router which supports all common 802.11 protocols including 802.11ax. This means it would work with older devices.\\n\\nPros: WiFi 6 support; Easy setup; WPA3 support for better security\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. This router supports 2 modes: Router and AP. Either mode requires wired WAN connection for Internet access. This means the router must be placed somewhere near the ISP Internet modem unless you would run a long Ethernet cable. This is fine for small home/office where 1 router is sufficient covering the entire space. For a larger coverage area, 3rd party WiFi extender/repeater must be used since there is no wireless AP mode for this router.\\n\\n2. I have the following WiFi setups: this router (Cudy WiFi 6 AX1800), an old Netgear 802.11n Router, EDUP WiFi 6 AX1500 EasyMesh routers (3). My Internet is FiOS 50/50. My PC has a WiFi 6 adapter (Intel AX200). All 3 main routers are near the ISP modem and about same distance from my PC. Attached are screenshots taken from my PC for WiFi connection properties to each router and screenshots from my iPhone for Internet SpeedTest. This is on WiFi 5G band connection.\\n\\nWiFi connection Link speed (Receive/Transmit):\\nCudy –144/288 (Mbps);\\nNetGear – 300/300 (Mbps);\\nEDUP Mesh – 721/961 (Mbps).\\nWiFi Internet SpeedTest (Download/Upload):\\nCudy – 49.0/10.4 (Mbps);\\nNetGear – 57.1/51.4 (Mbps);\\nEDUP – 57.3/51.3 (Mbps)\\n\\nAbove data indicate that although supporting WiFi 6, the 5G band performance of the Cudy AX1800 router is actually not as good as my old Netgear 802.11n router which is actually max out the 802.11n link speed. I’d conclude with following observations.\\n1. Performance of budget router, i.e. Cudy (WiFi 6) vs old NetGear (WiFi 4), the named brand still holds its ground for its value after 2 WiFi generations.\\n2. Budget router with EasyMesh works well so do consider budget routers in Mesh mode before buying name brand routers. It can save you money! In my case, go EDUP AX1500 routers!\\n3. Link speed is only useful for LAN traffic such as video streaming within the home/office WiFi network. But Internet performance is bottlenecked by the ISP data plan. In my case, download/upload speeds are capped at around 50/50 (Mbps). As such, for Internet access, the raw speed is about the same for my old NetGear 802.11n router and my EDUP 802.11ax router. The Cudy 802.11ax router is obviously an under-performer with all things being equal. Specifically, the Internet upload would be much slower than the other 2 routers.\\n\\nOverall, the Cudy WiFi 6 router is functional but lack of features such as wireless AP mode and EasyMesh support for covering larger area. Performance wise, its signal can drop quickly when distance increases.

Luckily most of my devices can connect at 5GHz so this works okay for me most of the time.

When I plugged in directly to my cable modem using an ethernet cable, I got about 53Mbps. So I plugged the ethernet cable into this wifi router, and my speed immediately dropped back to about 27Mbps. I have no idea why, but while this wifi router may be giving me great wifi bandwidth (it claims to be able to operate at upwards of 850Mbps!), it appears to be limited from this router to the modem at just under 30Mbps.\\n\\nSo yeah, I bought a more expensive router, and boom, I'm getting the full speed allotment. No other changes to my configuration.\\n\\nI'm still leaving my original rating of three stars, because this router is so inexpensive, but my advice is to only buy it if you are on a budget and don't have a very big internet pipe.

       " '2nd Review 4 stars: Received replacement router 3Apr2019. Belkin Customer Service walked me through firmware update and pairing my devices. Everything took about 1 hour, but for $19.99 & 2 year warranty & Belkin customer support, I am a happy camper. Will see if router needs resetting and how it operates in the next few weeks. If all is good, will update my 4 stars to 5. I gave Amazon another chance because the Belkin customer service was amazing. I returned for an exchange and received replacement 24hrs later. Strangely the router was not in an amazon box that obscured the contents. The Belkin router box had an address sticker on it and was left by my front door without them ringing the bell. What is up with amazon delivery lately? This is 3rd delivery issue in last few months.\\n\\n1st Router/1st review 1 star: Out of box I could not get the router to connect with the computer/modem but could access the router dashboard. I reset username, etc. but took a bit of troubleshooting with my computer & settings to get it working but only 2.5 MHz was showing up and not the 5MHz. Since I did not understand difference between 2.5 vs 5.0 I called Belkin customer service (Bcs). In short 2.5MHz is good long distance but slower (other rooms away from router); 5MHz good short distance and faster (in same room as router). We got the router working, but then my devices kept bouncing in and out of wifi and back to 2.5MHz. Turns out router required firmware update. Bcs talked me through the update, but then the computer could not find/recognize the IP address for the router and I had neither internet or wifi. So we hardwired the internet connection to the computer, downloaded firmware update direct from the Belkin website and re-set the router (reset button on back) and spent 1 hour and 34 min on phone with Belkin trouble shooting the installation, settings, etc. Final test showed binary is error which translated to \"Dead out of the box\". Belkin said to return to Amazon for another and to make sure it is not a refurbished unit but new. Once I receive the new router, run the download of the firmware update and restart everything, it should work (unless I get another dud). They said the reason the router is so cheap is because the firmware is outdated, but if the router is otherwise good, the update should work. I am giving Amazon another chance because the Belkin customer service was amazing, and the router has a 2 year warranty that they will honor once I exceed the Amazon return window. I returned for an exchange, will update if there are any issues with the exchange or with the replacement. I am back to using my Belkin N300 until I can switch out. But after this Belkin customer service experience...I will only buy Belkin routers.',\n",

Spectrum Cable kept increasing their speed and the latest increase coincided with the problems. I Figured a newer, faster model would work. It started out fine in the auto-setup but took a while to determine a connection method. Then it said there was a firmware update that I should apply. I did that and it said the router would reboot and that as soon as a steady blue light showed it would be ready. Well, the steady light never did happen. It kept blinking between orange and blue and when I tried to get to the web based setup it didn't even do that. It said I needed a new software file from Spectrum. After numerous reboot and reset attempts, I gave up and went down to Walmart and picked up a Linksys router. That one was up and ready to go in 10 minutes. Another reviewer here said he had problems with this router and Spectrum so maybe the 2 are just incompatible.\",\n",

My speed test often coming in under 1 Mbps. It's not my company, my home internet is extremely fast and my old box I just had for much too long so needed to replace. This is just not the one for me I believe.

After those couple of days of problems the box started working really well. The speed is great and the connection has been extremely reliable. I don't have to deal with the signal randomly dropping on me. I am, for now at least, happy with the purchase because for the price its performance is impressive.

I confirmed this with Belkin after spending considerable time trying to get the stated speed with my 1000Mbit/ (gigabit speed ) fibre optic internet. I made sure I had all the right stuff so there were no limiting factors.

Putting this router in between either through WIFI or using a LAN ethernet cable limited it to 90Mbits/second (in close proximity to one another)\\nIf you don\\'t need more than 90Mbits /second (around 10 Megabytes/second) this should work out fine for you.',\n",

I turned it on, waited a couple minutes, and the new SSID appeared under \"available wifi connections\" on all my devices. I just had to enter the new password (listed on the router) to connect each of my devices. This upgrade from my old FIOS router has provided much better coverage throughout my house, and a minimal increase in speed.

This router/gateway was used to replace an Verizon Actiontec router that was working fine but is only an 2.4 GHz band wireless router.\\n\\nThis used router had very minor scuffs and a missing HAN cover from the back of the router. This does not effect the operation of the router but is a cosmetic flaw. It had a tag saying \"Tested and Functional\" on it. After releasing the Broadband/Coax IP address in the Actiontec (you need to log into the Actiontec to do this) I unplugged the power from the Actiontec so it would not renew the IP Address before I connected this Verizon G1100. I then connected the cables to the G1100 and powered it up. After 5-10 minutes, I was able to log into the G1100 from the connected PC without an issue. I was able to use the Verizon My FiOS app to log into the router remotely, which you can not do with the Actiontec router.\\n\\nThis used router is being used in a business location, not for home use. It is running digital phones and wireless building thermostats, cams, printer, PC, STB. I have used it for more than a week and there are NO issues with this router/gateway so far. I am getting more speed than what the Actiontec was getting, I measured 5-6 meg more. The wireless coverage is the same with this router. I have seen no improvement as it has to cover two buildings and the walls are quite thick. The 2.4 GHZ band is used more here because of the distance the signal has to travel.\\n\\nI would make sure if you buy a used router and going to use it with Verizon service, you stick with Verizon firmware installed on the router already. I know how to overcome tech problems, but I would not advise starting with the wrong brand firmware to begin with. Also you will see all the old devices that the router was connected to in its past life. To remove them you need to assign a static ip to each one and THEN remove them. There is no easy way to remove them in the router GUI, but leaving them will cause no harm to the router operation anyway.

When I logged into the router at 192.168.1.1 the settings page was branded Frontier. I'm in NY so i have no idea who that is. The router itself is physically identical to the one i was replacing. I unplugged the power, coax, verizon ethernet, and my ethernet cables, switched routers, plugged everything back in where it was, and voila, everything worked. TV, internet, phone as before. I was worried about the Frontier thing, so much so that I called Verizon beforehand. They were like, just swap it out, so that was a wasted call. My return kit is on the way from Verizon. Can't wait to get that fee off my bill, which is too damn high anyway. Reading the reviews, I can see that some people had bad experiences. With a techy thing like a router I'm not surprised.

Apparently it can be activated in some markets, but Verizon could not activate it in Washington, DC. I wasted hours on the phone with Verizon, moving the router to different coaxial outlets, booting, rebooting, hard-resetting, running diagnostics, etc. I was led to believe that this router would ship with Verizon firmware, as I knew to avoid one with Frontier firmware.\\n\\nEven IF you are able to get this router working with Verizon Fios, Verizon won't support it or push firmware updates to it.

Inside my home connected directly to my WiFi, I get downloads of 80mbps to 110mbps depending on the day / time. 50mbps seems reasonable to me in RV given the distance and obstacles. Results will likely be better inside the home, but my intended use is with the RV both at home and at campgrounds. I had also tried a Alpha Camp Pro 2 Mini as it was touted as being great for RV's but found it's performance terrible (0.6mbps download) and set up was complicated as I found I had to connect to a Windows computer via ethernet to get it working. iPhone set up did not work on the Alpa.

Now we have full signal with fast WiFi (similar speed or faster than the cable company wireless modems).\\n\\nSetup through Spectrum (Time Warner) was quick and seamless. Connected to the router with the included Cat5 cable. Download the App and register. This initiates the main box. Then plugged in the other 2 units one at a time to connect them through the app (they were registered and working within 30 seconds each).\\n\\nThe most difficult part of the process: Deciding where to plug in the extenders, and setting up the WiFi on all connected devices. Literally no big deal.\\n\\nOne of my favorite features is that you can monitor the system through the App, as well as turn off the light on any individual unit.',\n",
       " \"Ok, I have only had this for a few hours running. Here is the good and the bad.\\n\\nGood:\\nThe mesh cubes connected with no interaction from me other than plugging in the power. Wonderfully easy.\\nThis is most certainly overkill for my house. 1500 sq ft ranch. However it was built in the early 1900's so the walls are chicken wire and plaster. Almost making my house a faraday cage all by its self lol. Every wireless router I have had could not penetrate these walls easily. Leaving dead spots every where in the house. This is supposed to cover 6,000 sq ft. It does now cover my entire house and out into my yard for 20-40ft or so.So the coverage and the switching between mesh cubes is absolutely seamless. If the hardware holds up, it does a great job of getting through my chicken wire and plaster walls. None of the cubes are what I would consider in ideal locations either.\\n\\nNow this is part bad and part good. The install, if I had of known the issues below, would have been super easy. reboot modem, connect after a few minutes, set wifi id and password and you were pretty close to being done. However, because I didnt know you couldnt even set basic dhcp settings, I spent a couple hours trying to get this up and running\\n\\nUnsure:\\nThe Wifi has both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. You can not separate them or turn one of them on/off or even set separate IDs. The cubes automatically bounce you between 2.4ghz and 5 ghz depending on your signal and throughput.Its both good and bad, bad if you like to have certain devices only on 1 bandwidth. now you cant separate them\\n\\nNow the bad\\n\\nBad:\\n\\nThe power adapters. the prongs are facing the wrong way. Instead of the adapter being out to the side of your power strip, Its going to cover at least 1 or 2 spots on your power strip unless you have an end spot open. I still dont understand why these are even an issue in 2018. Is it that hard to make it so it doesnt take up other spots on the power strip?\\n\\nThere is virtually no setup you can do with the Tenda network app. It will not allow you to set your own dhcp range. In fact, it gives you the option for 10.0.0.1 or the ip address from your modem, . Now here is the over the top upsetting one. It will give you a 192.168 address but... and your going to love this... 192.168.5.x address.\\nWTF?????? why in any sane civilized world would it select 192.168.5 for anything nor will it let you change it? Oh, all your devices that are configured with static ips are no longer even on the same freaking subnet!!!!\\n\\nHere is one thats just going to make some folks laugh. It does allow you to have port forwarding but, and I cant stress how bad this is enough.... It does not allow you to set static IPs. what good is port forwarding when your ip is going to change? 99.9% useless.\\nThere is also no web interface to get to via your computer.\\nI called tech support and asked about these issues. While the guy was very nice, I was basically told the current revision does not allow any of those things. Its possible it may get added in future revisions but I mean come on, this is super basic router stuff that any $20 router will have.\\nAnother issue. This assigns a connection specific dns setting to tendrawifi.com\\nThis causes your first 2 dns lookups to fail as its trying to resolve this tendawifi.com suffix, then it will go to your dns settings in the router. This is very bad and needs to be removed.\\nThis has been out for at least 5 months that I can tell, and none of these features have been added in that time? Either this is currently their first actual live rev or I cant even imagine what functionality it didnt have if there are earlier revs.\\n\\nThere is no dynamic dns options for those of us that like to remote into our home systems either (probably a little more advanced feature)\\n\\nNow with all this said, this could easily be a 4-5 star product IF and this is a huge IF they add these basic features that can be found in practically the cheapest routers known to man all over the world... This is for firmware version 1.0.0.14(4258)\\n\\nIm trying to make this work but I have a feeling im going to have to send this system back.Its just lacking in so many basic needed features.I would say that if you are average joe user with almost no networking knowledge and are trying to set this up, You could do it easy enough. But if you do anything other than connect your computer and tablets to it, your not going to be able to do any configuration. This means cameras with static ips are screwed, any servers you may be running and a host of other stuff. This firmware needs serious work.\\n\\nEdit note: If these features get added, I would gladly update my rating to reflect it. Like I said, this has great potential. They just need to get some basic features in and some advanced features would be nice as well, Dynamic Dns, configurable vpn so you can use the vpn settings of your favorite service. Some basic firewall settings as well.\\n\\nUpdate Number 1 4/20/18\\nThey updated the wifi app and added 2 new features.\\nQOS\\nAnd guess what, you can now assign your ip range. Well, the starting range of the detected choices. You get a pinwheel to select your numbers. Still have a long way to go, but it appears they are listening.\",\n",

       " 'Please don\\'t laugh at me when I divulge that I currently 48 WiFi devices in my home. As I added more Echo Dots, thermostats, smart plugs, smart bulbs, cameras, door locks, garage door opener, TVs, smartphones, laptops, printers and tablets it became a major challenge to keep them ALL linked to one TP-Link CR1900 Modem Router.\\n\\nLogic told me to try WiFi range extenders. I tried Netgear, D-Link, Linksys, TP-Link but no matter what they cost or where I placed up to 4 of them in my 2 story 2100sf home, several WiFi devices would disconnect nearly ever day. Then I started researching mesh WiFi systems. Before spending $200 to $500 for one of the advertised brands sold by brick & mortar stores, I decided to try the Tenda NOVA MW3 based on other amazon reviews.\\n\\nSetup of the NOVA system was the EASIEST thing I\\'ve ever installed in years!\\n1. Turn off the WiFi of my TP-Link Modem Router (log in to browser 192.168.1.1 and uncheck Enable boxes).\\n2. Reboot Modem\\n3. Using Tenda supplied Ethernet cable, connect a LAN port on modem to WLAN post on any one of the NOVA modules.\\n4. Plug the Tenda module into a power outlet.\\n5. Using the Tenda app I installed on my smartphone, follow the simple handful of steps until module GREEN light is solid.\\n6. Plug the other 2 Tenda modules in other parts of the house but preferably no more than about 30 feet from the main module. DONE!\\nWithin seconds of having done this, the app screen said it found and linked 48 devices to my WiFi. I tested each and every device. I checked the signal strength all around my home and it never said less than \"average\" but says \"Good\" in 75% including back yard and front yard.\\n\\nMy Cox internet service delivers 120Mbps. Now the Tenda MW3 is delivering a 45Mbps to 77Mbps WiFi signal no matter where I am inside the home and up to 25 feet outside.\\nThis may be the BEST $95 I\\'ve spent on any gadget in years and costs much less than any of the advertised brands at brick & mortar stores.\\n\\n12/06/2018 UPDATE: Tenda MW3 worked flawlessly UNTIL TODAY. Suddenly, 42 of the 48 WiFi devices in 2story 2100sf home were getting any signal. I rebooted (unplugged power to main cube) for 10 seconds. Some devices came back online. Tested the signal strength with my smartphone at various locations using speedtest app. Signal varied from 16Mbps to 21Mbps which is MUCH lower than what it was until today.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE: Was great but in less than 2 weeks has proven to be UNRELIABLE (erratic) and will be replaced with another brand at a higher price. It\\'s a shame because setup was so easy.\\n\\nLINKSYS VELOP was system I tried next. The Tenda is MUCH faster to setup, performs much better than the Linksys and is up to $200 less expensive than the Linksys Velop. linksys failed to find 7 of my WiFi devices that were found even by my TP-Link modem router WiFi signal. I will wait to see what new mesh systems I find at the 2019 CES Show in Vegas which will hopefully be much better.',\n",
       " 'So I gotta first say that I\\'m not looking for any local gigabit connections with my home network - just reliable 2g/5g signal throughout the property. My main cable modem are in the corner basement of my home with my TV room, and I wanted coverage upstairs and in the detached garage, which is about 25 feet from my home, and about 70 feet from the cable modem and the primary Tenda Nova node in my basement (With the Tenda Nova installed, the garage node does switch between \"good\" and \"fair\" signal - but it does not effect the overall speed, and keep in mind it\\'s going through the back of a TV, 3 home walls, my main electric box, and 2 garage walls to get to my garage utility room - that\\'s pretty amazing!)\\n\\nPreviously I was having a heck of a time getting a good signal to the garage, event with a wifi extender (went through 2 of them with very broken and inconsistent results). With my prior Asus MIMO router (which is amazing!) my Amazon Tap was having trouble staying connected in the garage, and wifi was a inconsistent outside. I always wanted a whole home mesh router, but didn\\'t want to spend $300 on it. The Nova system is absolutely fantastic for $100. They also have the model MW6, which does support gigabit, but as I said, I don\\'t need that.\\n\\nAlso, their iPhone app is actually very convenient for both setup and monitoring the nodes and the overall usage - I was very skeptical about the app, but there are plenty of basic options like guest-network, QOS, firmware updating, maintenance rebooting, etc.\\n\\nSetup is seriously a breeze. The only thing that I ran into was needing to turn off my modem, then turning it back on after initial plug in. It did not find the modem and internet connection type until I reset the modem - so be sure you do that! I setup the first note, set my own network information, and then connected the other 2 nodes. The other nodes connected and were up and running within about 2 minutes. Keep in mind the wifi signal goes in and out for about 2 minutes while it\\'s connecting the other nodes, so just be patient and you\\'ll see that they connect after about 2 minutes. So far, very satisfied - much much much better than wifi extenders! If you don\\'t hear an update, then all is well!\\n\\n**quick update - I read some reviews that said there is not a firewall in this router, but I contacted Tenda directly, and they said there IS a firewall: \"Yes there is a firewall it is automatically enabled, if you need to get past it you can port forward.\" So good news there!\\n\\nI also reconfigured where I placed the 3 nodes, and now I\\'m getting full/good signal on all of them, even in my garage. Still really happy with this kit!',\n",

       " \"The setup for the two cube-shaped mesh routers in the box was disturbingly easy. Having set up a number of routers over the last decade or so, I'm used to needing to do a lot of work to get things up and running, and having something instantly and insistently fail.\\n\\nI was able to, in the span of ten minutes, unbox one cube, shut down my existing modem and router combo, swap out the router for this little cube, install the app on a phone since that's how they want you to set it up, and power up everything.\\nThe in-app setup was almost too easy, as I had the network named the way I wanted, with the password we needed, all with minimal, guided effort. Getting the second cube set up 30 feet and one thick wall away was very, very easy. All that was needed was positioning the cube, and getting it power. Beyond that, it paired itself, and had a good, solid connection inside of two minutes.\\n\\nI spent five minutes afterward, cursing and complaining that it was too easy to set up.\\n\\nThere are a number of out-of-box quirks that I've observed:\\n1. There is no web-based user interface AT ALL.\\nYes, for those of you who like to manage your routers from the comfort of your desktop browser, this is well and truly not available.\\nIt forces you to rely on your Android or iOS bearing cellphone or tablet to manage connections and see who's connected, what IP address they have in the network, and so on. For those of us who still use Windows Phone or Windows Mobile, we're out of luck.\\n\\n2. There is no IPv6 support! This is very disappointing, given that this is hardware that supports 802.11ac, the current standard for wireless connections, made long after it's been known that IPv4 is facing depletion.\\nIt's an annoyance, but NAT is a thing that's been going on for a while. I'll deal with it, especially since it's possible for a future firmware update to actually add in IPv6 support.\\n\\n3. The default IP range is strange, but there are a couple of other choices in the app.\\n\\n4. There's no option to set a dedicated IP for hardware that connects to the network.\\nThis will make printing a small headache, as we have one laser printer which would fare best with a static IP.\\n\\nThe Tenda app is still useful, as it does help you to visually identify what is connected to your network, including the brand, operating system, or given hostname of most devices. I could identify my desktop PC immediately, along with the smart TV, my tablet, and my cellphone. As others came online, I could identify them, from the lonely Amazon Echo Dot upstairs to an HTC cellphone, and a laptop. There are handy dots running down the left side of the device page with brand logos, and info on whether a device is using a 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or wired connection in the case of the printer.\\nThe connection to the router will attempt to auto-negotiate the fastest options first, so wired devices that can also be plugged in will go to the wired connection first. Wireless devices will attempt to latch on to the 5 GHz connection first, and only if that fails does it move down to the 2.4 GHz connection. It will start with Wireless-AC first, and then negotiates down to Wireless-N. It may go further, but I lack devices to test that far down the spectrum at the moment.\\n\\nFor those who need wired connections, each cube has ONE, repeat ONE Ethernet port on it for your use. I've not tested whether it will let you use a switch with that port to multiplex that out.\\n\\nOn wireless connections, though, I've not had a connection this strong since moving into this house, even with a traditional repeater setup. I'm pulling 150-160 Mbps down from our ISP according to a casual SpeedTest run, which is just under our modem's speed cap, from the far end of our house, and it is beautiful.\\nFor comparison, prior to this installation, I would pull 30-40 Mbps from the same computer.\\n\\nThe short takeaway from this is simple:\\nIf you need a mesh router system that is simple, has no bells and whistles, and is most importantly EASY to set up, Tenda has a nice piece of kit here for an easy price.\\n\\nIf you need additional bells and whistles, and deeper configuration, you may need to look at more traditional solutions, as it is not available in this hardware and software config.\",\n",
       " \"I was hesitant to buy this system because it was so inexpensive compared to the top rated ones. I have Xfinity in a 2 story, 4 bedroom house and was constantly losing connection to the internet no matter where I was in the house. Some parts of the house was worse than others. So I decided to upgrade my router and found out about mesh wifi. I read a lot of articles and did lots of comparing before deciding on this Tenda Nova system. I like that it has only 1 corded node, which is the main one that gets hooked up to the modem. The secondary nodes are plugged right into the outlet so I have have no unsightly cords. Plus, the areas that I placed the secondary nodes are hallways so they would have been sticking out like sore thumbs if I bought the pack where all three nodes looked like the main node. I have had great internet connection everywhere in the house since installing this system. The setup through the app was incredibly simple and it's great to be able to see all the devices that are connected. The app even does a bit of troubleshooting for you if something goes wrong. Like the other day, I suddenly lost connection so I tried to restart my modem first and nothing happened. So I went into the Tenda wifi app and it told me that the WAN cord was disconnected.

       " \"First I am a retired cyber security analyst with 30+ years of experience. That time was spent working for both federal agencies in the United States and with one of the largest network companies in the world. I have spent a great deal of time setting up networking gear that is far more complex than anything Netgear has to offer.\\n\\nHaving had other Netgear products in the past I chose the R7800 for several reasons.\\n\\n1. My failing LInksys router needed to be replaced. The model I had could not be flashed with OpenWRT.\\n2. The Netgear Nighthawk series in general has typically had good reviews.\\n3. I have owned other Netgear products in the past. Most of those work without issue.\\n\\nThis specific model was chosen because it met my criteria.\\nPerformance benchmarks vs price.\\nAbility to flash OpenWRT\\nSATA port\\nReputation\\n\\nUsing the stock setup wizard I found several issues that would likely cause headaches and a high number of RMA's for Netgear.\\n\\nFirst the setup script is broken. When you complete the setup the router will loop back to start the setup again. While I understand how to bypass this the average user is going to get frustrated , give up and RMA. Netgear obviously contracted this work out and did piss poor QA as it is flat broken.\\n\\nSecond, the GUI, Netgear has not updated their GUI in a very long time. While the layout of the UI is ok, it is clunky and looks like Romper Room threw up. Additionally for the average user it is confusing and slow. Obviously zero user experience testing was done.\\n\\nThird, the firmware. It is the weak link here. Its buggy , slow and slow does not even start to describe it. I do not expect commercial performance from a consumer router but this is pathetic. Given the size of the software , its functionality and the speed of the CPU and the amount of RAM the device has, it just sucks.\\n\\nForth and the kicker, Device performance. I spent hours trying to tune this device using the stock firmware. I wanted to see what it would do and if it would deliver on the stated promises. While these are typically overblown and the online reviews are biased and paid for , I understand the baseline is typically as much as 60% of the stated specs.\\n\\nAll that being said I tested it. Using the default settings on 2.4ghz the best I could get was an average of 30mb/sec\\nOn 5.8ghz the average was a pathetic 92mb/sec.\\n\\nThis was done using 10 different devices , all reset with factory defaults. This was a combination of IOS, Windows 10, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, OSX 10.12, 10.14, Kali Linux 2019.2, Ubuntu 19.04 and Android 9.\\n\\nWhile these are averages , the best I could get on 2.4ghz was 48mb/sec and 121mb/sec on 5.8ghz\\n\\nThis is Sub $50 router performance.\\n\\nBorked firmware, These are tests after a firmware update. Unfortunately I was unable log test figures prior to teh firmware update however performance was somewhat better but still poor.\\n\\nContrary to what you are told these devices are actually NOT that complex. When support tells you it has a hardware problem, it probably does not have any hardware issues, its crap software. They will RMA the device reset it , plug it into a test rig and if it passes , Stamp refurb on it for folks like me.\\n\\nSo why did I buy a new one instead of a refurb? I did not want to take a risk of a broken or cracked case , missing antenna's and I wanted the warranty.\\n\\nI will likely return this product. I could simply flash it and it would likely be fine but Netgear needs to stop screwing customers. This oversold behavior should not be rewarded. DO NOT be sold on websites that claim 1200mb/sec through put, not going to happen. Do your research , ask a professional and save your money.\\n\\nI do NOT recommend this router for anyone unless your simply buying to flash it with something else. The stock firmware is a disaster. Looking for a gaming router? This is NOT the one...........\",\n",
       " 'I bought this router after having owned an ASUS RT-AC66U, which began having issues after just shy of 5 years of service. I was directed to this router by Small Net Builders, as it has one of the highest ratings, and highest wired throughputs.\\n\\nMy R7800 Nighthawk X4S is less than 11 months old. It worked well out of the box, and for the subsequent few months. About 8 months ago it began telling client devices that the 5Ghz password was incorrect. Same password for both 2.4 and 5ghz confirmed. Factory reset, reconfigure, works for an hour, same issue.\\n\\nGo to support...No phone support available except premium. Go to email and forums... email support very very basic, for folks who have little idea as to what a router does, let alone what and how to configure it. Go to forums....lots of condescending community members offering the same advice, trying to qualify if its truly an issue or just user error.\\n\\nFactory resets, firmware downgrades, and firmware upgrades have been temporarily useful, but the issue always comes back. Configuration changes based on Netgear Community threads have been tedious and unhelpful. In sum, It has been plagued by issues since Feb 2018 and Netgear offers no resolution. A quick google search will show you scores of others with similar issues, with many blaming firmware as the issue.\\n\\nPros: The router has good 2.4 and 5 ghz ranges, especially in uncongested environments. It is capable of high wired throughput when minimally configured*** It offers a 4x4 configuration for increase signal quality as well as increased potential throughput with the correct clients.\\n\\nCons: Instability on wireless networks. Inability to access 5ghz network without factory resetting router often. Wired throughput from WAN -> LAN substantially reduced with any \"features\" enabled. All the hardware in the world would make no difference if the firmware/software/drivers are bunk, thus in my case the high performance 5ghz network is moot.\\n\\nOther thoughts:***The max wired throughput from WAN -> LAN requires you to not use features such as Access Control, Site blocking, Service blocking, Port forwarding(less impactful), Quality of Service and most other services offered on the router. If you have gigabit internet, you will be unable to see full service. I see quite a few folks mention going to a third party firmware with substantial improvement in stability, but inability to access the full array of hardware in the box, leading to reduced performance comparatively, but with huge stability gains.',\n",

Prior to this upgrade, I was getting speeds between 5 to 20 mbs, I was continually having my cell phones drop off the wifi and long buffering while streaming TV. Now with the Netgear AC2600, my internet speed are coming in between 90 to 120 mps. I have not had any dropped WIFI from my phones and virtually no buffering on my TV's.\\nAs a test, I tried to load it up. I was streaming 2 Fire Stick TV's with HD movies, 2 cell phones and 1 Ipad with youtube HD videos at the some time. It handled it perfectly. I was truly amazed.\\nSet up was a breeze. I am not a networking guru, I just used all the basic features of the Netgear Genie, and was up and running in about 10 minutes. I should have upgraded a long time ago!\",\n",

As it kept occurring, I noticed it more and more, and it makes this router pretty much worthless for anything that doesn't have a buffer- like online gaming, skyping, etc. Nothing real time can be done with this router, because you don't know when it is going to drop the connection for 20-30 seconds. I work from home a couple of days a week, and it is embarrassing when I don't know what was said in meetings for 30 seconds...Looks like lots of other people are having the same problem.

       " 'Hello! Short version up here!\\n\\nIf you are experiencing 1-5 second dropouts on your wireless network like clockwork (every 5-10 minutes) then you need to Roll back your FIRMWARE VERSION. You probably have a version ending in .58 or .60. You need the 1.0.2.52 firmware version.\\n\\nLong review, details, and explanation below.\\n\\nIf you are playing a game using the wireless network (not LAN) and every 5 to 10 minutes your connection drops for 2-10 seconds, or you are watching a stream on twitch/youtube and it regularly cuts out LISTEN UP. It is your FIRMWARE. To be clear, I am not talking about a spotty connection. I am talking about a full on 50-300mbps constant wireless communication that has practically no latency EXCEPT, every 5-10 minutes, it cuts out like someone turned off the wireless transmitter. This makes any online gaming UNPLAYABLE as just about every server will drop you since your computer essentially disconnects for those 1-5 seconds like a wifi plug was pulled.\\n\\nIf that is the case, you probably have 1.0.2.58 or 1.0.2.60. You can check by logging into the router (Default 192.168.1.1) and checking to see in the upper right corner what version number you are on. If it ends in a .58 or .60 or higher, that is 99% your problem.\\n\\nYou need to go to Netgear\\'s website and download 1.0.2.52 for the X4S R7800. The .52 version is the latest STABLE WIFI build. Upload it (maybe hard reset) and reconfigure your router and BAM, problem solved!\\n\\nNetgear customer support is less than useless and won\\'t admit fault regarding the firmware update. Period. They will constantly ask you to hard reset your router and blame interference in your environment over acknowledging the router is the issue. I have not done networking and IT for long, but I know how to use network analysis tools and watch ping/turnaround time and monitor when throughput drops.\\n\\nTo verify this issue, I tested with the AC frequencies and channels, and the B/G/N frequencies and channels as well. All still suffered a regular 1-10 second dropout every 5-10 minutes like clockwork. Different devices (Note 8 streaming twitch, 3 different desktops playing games/streaming, TV streaming, Steamlink streaming, etc) all behaving the EXACT same.\\n\\nTo help reinforce the point that this was the router, I dug out a DECADE old Relic (the D-Link DSL-2640T) and set it up in the same spot, and fired up its \"Deluxe dual channel B/G wireless network\" and my signal was rock solid consistent. I was capping out around 50 Mbps all over my house in connection with the router, but I could stream live videos, have Skype calls, and game for HOURS without any drops whatsoever.\\n\\nA DECADE old B/G 54mbps router was beating the pants off of this B/G/N AC 2600mbps powerhouse in terms of reliable steady internet connection. Nobody wants a sports car you have to push start every 5-10 miles if their Grandma\\'s station wagon will actually get you around town.\\n\\nOnce I rolled back the firmware to the 1.0.2.52, the signal issue evaporated. No more inconsistency issues, no latency spikes, all smooth sailing, my old D-Link can go back in its dusty coffin.\\n\\nIn all, Netgear Customer Support won\\'t help you since that involves admitting they made a mistake they have yet to fix. Do yourself a favor and roll back to 1.0.2.52 and disable auto updates under Advanced>Administration>Firmware Updates and choose the \"I disagree\" option.\\n\\nThanks for reading!',\n",

I usually have at least 4 devices that need network connectivity, and a couple more that can be used offline. But there are times when I'm staying at a hotel or resort that has questionable Wifi.\\n\\nI have not actually taken this on the road, so it may not help... but I've run a bunch of tests on it to see what my expectations should be. I hope to express my findings here.\\n\\nSo... the picture is a bit misleading. This is smaller than 1/2 the size of a deck of cards... so, pretty fricken tiny. The antennas rotate and fold, or can be completely disconnected when packing, so it's pretty easy to pack.... if that's what you want. But... you may not want to pack it away.... I'll explain later.\\n\\nWifi throughput: I had two devices that are 30ft from the base unit. One was uploading large files to the USB drive connected to the base unit. One was streaming a movie that was stored on the USB drive. The transfer rate reported by the upload client was 1.3MB/s... not too shabby. The movie being streamed never experienced any delays or glitches.\\n\\nPower Consumption: I have a small battery pack that is not useful for my phone because my phone needs more power than what the battery pack can provide. But all of my tests were done with the base unit connected to the battery pack. So far, it's been on the battery pack for 2 hours, and consumed only 1/2 the power. This would make the device useful on a flight where you might want to share WiFi among your family that's traveling with you, but don't want to pay multiple Wifi fees. So.. you may want this in your carry-on, and not packed away.\\n\\nSignal strength: Because I was able to power this with a battery pack, that meant I could test the signal strength at greater distances. I brought the base unit outside, multiple layers of walls, and a distance (30ft) from my in-home Wifi router. It didn't have any problems. I will update with an actual limit test. But for now, I'm pretty impressed. On the other side... I placed the unit in my front yard, and went to my back yard... so again... multiple layers of walls, and even a greater distance (60ft). My phone didn't have any problem connecting. It showed 4 of 5 bars, and never lost the connection.\\n\\nOpenVPN: OMG!!!! This is probably one of the coolest features. At home, I have a Cisco router that supports OpenVPN. I downloaded the OVPN config file to my phone, then uploaded it to the router, added my credentials and BOOM!!! It was connecting to my home network via VPN. It was such a fricken easy setup, I had a hard time believing that it was actually going to work. And... by tweaking a setting, you can turn on and off the VPN using the switch on the side. So, you don't have to connect to the Admin Page to enable VPN.\\n\\nSetup: The Admin Page is pretty ficken intuitive with menus named the way you might expect them to be. You really only have to tweak a few settings to be up and running.\\n\\nCON: Okay... it's not 100% good. There is only one USB port. So if you're tethering via USB to your phone or using an other form of USB network, you can't share contents of a USB drive. There's no reason, they couldn't have added a second USB port. The box is big enough for 2 or more, or they could have used a Micro-USB or USB-C port.\\n\\nBottom Line: I'm expecting this will perform well when I actually take it on the road. I believe this is well worth the price. I recommend this 100%.\",\n",

But it fails over in less than a second. Practically instant. From what I've read, only WAN bonding can sustain a break in a connection like that. I have no problems gaming with load balancing enabled.\\n\\nI have a Unite Explore tethered over USB (configured as pass through) with a Netgear Nighthawk M1 over ethernet, both with external Netgear MIMO antennas. For some reason, load balancing didn't want to work by default, I had to edit some settings, and then reboot it a few times to get them to stick. I'm using USB + Wan for load balancing, and I wasn't even sure that would work. I couldn't find anyone else on the forums that was trying to do that.\\n\\nYes, I use this for home internet. It recognized my AT&T Unite Explore immediately with almost no configuration, and gave me 40Mbps+ down and 30Mbps up under ideal tower conditions. My phone is a tad faster, but hotspots have less priority than phones/tablets. The forums say they push ~90Mbps over the Wan/Lan interface over ethernet, so I wouldn't think this would be a bottleneck for LTE use.\\n\\nLoad balancing does make surfing *feel* faster, and other people using the internet do not noticeably affect me. Multiple videos in multiple tabs load noticeably faster. Downloads are faster only when you have multiples or are using a download manager. Uploads are faster, more consistent in speed, and this makes all browsing peppier. Latency is marginally improved (~5ms).\\n\\nWIFI penetration is acceptable inside a log cabin with a huge stone fireplace. Not great, but at this price, that's not a con. I will upgrade the antennas soon.\\n\\nI've had to reboot it a few times over a couple of days span a few months back. I changed out my charger/PS to something rated for over 2A at 5V. No problems since. It powers my Unite Explore over USB, so maybe this was a factor in the original power supply with my WIFI output maxed out in the settings. I think I also had the WIFI on and range maxed out on the UE at that time. I was still experimenting.\\n\\nI've also noticed with a USB port voltmeter that not all cables will push over 1.5A, so make sure your cables aren't 1)cheap or 2)going out. I had a cable that tested perfect, and weeks later the wife said it wasn't fast charging on the QC 3.0 charger. I tested it, and it was not. Changed cables, and her phone was quick charging immediately. I can see how this would cause reliability problems with a travel router, as cables get twisted, stretched, and kinked constantly.\\n\\nSo,in summary, for nearly 6 months, hardly any reboots have been necessary, and none since the larger power supply and cable check. More reliable than any other router I've had that cost less than $100, while pushing more data than I pushed through any of them in a month, and using load balancing on top of all of that, over LTE as well, spanned over USB/Ethernet interfaces. I have two desktops, 3 phones, 1 tablet, a Fire Stick that sees lots of use, and both desktops game often. All use VPN more often than not. I do not do much data transfer over the LAN side of things, so that might show it's lack of CPU. I've had 15 devices connected for a week at a time, and no issues. Most were phones, though.\\n\\nI use VyperVPN from the desktops and tablet, and they stay connected for several days at a time. I got the router to connect to VyperVPN, but as I said earlier, it was relatively poor performance at 256 bit encryption with OpenVPN. VyperVPN wasn't exactly plug and play like other services.\\n\\nHowever, we all know that the processor isn't a beast. This is low power. For what it costs, for its size, it has amazing functionality, and in context, reliability. OpenWRT allows this to be very, very flexible if you're tech oriented.\\n\\nI have yet to use the USB for anything but tethering and testing the webcam functionality, so I can't comment on its proficiency as a baby NAS or print server. My printer is ethernet.\\n\\nOverall, this is a great value, and I can see it capable of many different uses. I'll probably buy a few more and see what the Mesh performance is like. Pittsburgh Mesh uses an older version of these with great success.\",\n",

I have multiple TP-Link models, a Hoo-Too model, a couple other white box things, stuff I've cobbled together myself with Raspberry Pis and this beats them all. The two things that really set this apart are the support for usb phone tethering and out of the box OpenVPN support. I know some of the reviews say you need some tech expertise to set this thing up, but you definitely don't have to be an expert. The OpenVPN configuration is about as easy as they come, the UI is straightforward and lets you get as involved as you want or just pick some simple options, and the other thing I absolutely love is a reset button that is literally a button. I have to reset these routers all the time (When they get stuck in WISP or Station mode and I don't have an ethernet cord...) then I have to go find a paperclip...giant PITA. These has an easy to press button you can hit with your finger. I'm thinking about ordering the MicroSD model too just to tinker with.

It worked right out of the box. I powered it on, connected to it, accessed its config panel with a browser, and I was up and running sharing a public WiFi in no time at all.\\n\\nSecond reason why it rocks? The firmware update happened ON THE DEVICE ITSELF!!! I was able to check for a firmware update using the control panel, the file downloaded TO THE DEVICE, and then the device UPDATED ITSELF!!! No annoying external storage with a file that I needed to download on another computer... ugh. The Hootoo Travelmate was a horrific nightmare in this regard, and I still have yet to successfully update its firmware.\\n\\nThird reason of greatness: the range is amazing. For such a tiny, lightweight product, this thing packs a lot of power. It receives WiFi signals very well, and it transmits them just as well. I did get the model with external antennas because I'm more concerned with range than speed.\\n\\n4th reason of awesomeness: DD-WRT. This is a mature and complete system for managing this device's features. There's a ton of available add-ons for any and all functionality you could ever imagine.\\n\\nThe only thing I'd like to see added is an SD card slot. Seems to me like there's plenty of room for one in the housing, and it could be infinitely useful. There's a USB port for attaching external storage, but an SD card slot would be even more useful because it would keep everything compact and simple. Oh well, for the price, I can hardly complain.\\n\\nThe Hootoo Travelmate Titan does offer an internal battery at the same price point which is useful, but not necessary for my needs.

The Edimax BR-6258n stock firmware was good enough for my needs so I've had 2 of those running for many years with no issues.\\n\\nEnter my new first-world problem: I've been using the EasyTether Android app for a year to Bluetooth tether my tablet to my phone when traveling. My phone (LG G5) Bluetooth drops sporadically, so a few times a minute or maybe just a few times a day, I would have to switch back to the EasyTether client and reconnect. Also, for Bluetooth tethering to work between Android devices, you have to connect the client to a WiFi connection so it thinks it has a real network connection to work (I used one of my Edimax ones as a dummy AP). This finally got annoying enough for me to investigate switching to USB tethering.\\n\\nSince EasyTether has OpenWRT support, I thought I would give this GL-AR300M a try. The router powers up and sets up as easily as any commercial router. USB tethering with this app requires a bit more leg work, downloads, and terminal keystrokes, but I enjoyed the ~3-hour puzzle of reading forums, finding IPKs, and the eureka moment when it finally worked.\\nIn short:\\n- Install the clean NAND firmware from GL-INet.com\\n- Push dependent IPKs (also from GL-INet and EasyTether IPK to router & install with WinSCP from a Windows PC\\n- *ar71xx.ipk work with this router's chipset\\n- Follow EasyTether instructions to finish up\\n\\nAlso, for those interested in power demand, I ran this through a USB multi-meter off a dedicated 5V 1A USB power plug. The GL-AR300M draws between 150 and 250 mA by itself. When USB tethering, the router and USB device together pull between 550 and 650 mA. So, if just using the router by itself, a standard USB 2.0 port (or faster) should suffice.

There is no option to filer out domains (IE adult/bad sites), there WAS a free 3rd part service, but it is no longer free. This would be a basic feature for a router and not having that ability is very disappointing. It is very stable, I don't need to re-boot each week, so that's a plus.\\n\\nI was so hoping this router would be the be all, end all… I would give it 2.5 stars, but not 3. Below will be the long story. Here is the short review:\\nPro’s:\\nThe extra ports are great. I don’t need to have a switch hooked up to a port just to have all my wired devices hooked up. The options in the software are pretty good. Can do a lot of things most basic home routers can’t. You can tell its kinda build for a small office. Seems to be pretty fast both wired and wireless.\\n\\nCon’s:\\nRange of the wireless is not any better then the cheaper routers I have used. I have a standard stick built home, so no more interference then normal. The second 5Ghz band is very short on distance, It will work fine for a few devices that are close. And I mean short as in more the 15ft away through a wall and the signal is very low, add two walls at 20ft and its gone. The 2.4Ghz and first 5Ghz bands are fairly normal range as stated above. Setup can be difficult if you do not know about networking. I have setup corporate devices so, not a big deal for me, but others may have issues.\\n\\nLong Story:\\nThis is the second router I got. The first router would run for about 5 minutes on a cold boot, then would start a re-boot loop every 2-3 minutes after that. During that first 5 min I got logged into it and it showed a firmware update was available. When I tried to update it had a MD5 error. I was told that is a known bug after talking with support. But with the re-booting there was no way I would have been able to update via a download of the firmware. Support had me do the whole reset, unplug, etc… but did not help, would start the re-booting. So I sent for a replacement from Amazon. I sent in the old router and got a “new” one. “New” I say because you can tell it was used. The foam wrap was not on it. The antenna were not in the plastic bag like the first one I got. The power cord twisty tie was not on the power cord. Also the firmware was already updated, but maybe that was from the factory? But that is the one I am using as of now. Luckily there is an extended time to return with the holiday shopping, so if I start having issues with this one I will send in for a refund. I will not try a third device. The pictures are from the second router I got so you can see it was used and not packed up like new. I wish I had taken a pic of the first to compare it to, but I did not.\",\n",
       " 'I have found the TRENDnet AC3000 is highly unreliable. It needs to be manually power-cycled every few days. Every few days, it would get into a state where new device (or a device with expired lease) cannot connect, the web management interface would not be accessible, and the only way to recover is to manually power-cycle the TRENDnet AC3000. It got to a point where I configure the TRENDnet AC3000 to reboot itself twice a week, and still there were times when manual power-cyclings were necessary.\\n\\nThe documentation claims that the TRENDnet AC3000 allows the configuration of \"Guest SSID\", and up to eight different SSIDs. The web management interface offers no way to actually configure \"eight SSIDs\", so this feature is not usable. I also could not get the \"Guess SSID\" to work; even though the web management interface says I have successfully configured the \"Guess SSID,\" I could never get any device to actually connect to the \"Guess SSID.\" So as far as I am concerned, the \"Guess SSID\" feature does not work.\\n\\nAfter I acquired a different router, I tried to see if I could salvage the TRENDnet AC3000 by configuring it to work as a simple Wi-Fi Access Point -- even that is impossible. To be fair, the TRENDnet AC3000 literature never claims to have this feature of operating simply as a Wi-Fi Access Point. Still, it\\'s another disappointment that, even after giving up using it as a \"router,\" I cannot salvage it to use as a Wi-Fi Access Point.\\n\\nThe feature list of the TRENDnet AC3000 looks really good on paper, the \"dual-WAN\" fail-over feature works (I think), but the overall implementation leaves much to be desired, with unreliability being its biggest issue.',\n",

This router has not disappointed so far - instead of having to collect their devices before bed to make sure they are not online at all hours, I can simply go into the parent controls screen in the router interface and selectively block individual devices (namely - their devices) from accessing the router after 9pm. The access hours are very customizable - you can set \"off limits\" hours at bedtime, and you can also set a block of time around dinner when they cannot be online. This router has been great with helping me to establish more structure as a parent. This is especially important and necessary with the recent COVID19 situation, where kids are online more than ever. You can also block specific web sites in the router interface as well.\\n\\nBesides the excellent parental controls, this router has not disappointed in terms of speed - I noticed an immediate improvement in the internet speed after setting this router up.

       " \"Purchased this router less than a year ago as an upgrade to my Asus RT-AC68U. Primarily wanted this router for its beamforming capabilities since I operated heavily on wireless AC, at the time. Its Adaptive QoS settings appeared to be a step up from the AC68U, which now allowed me to further tweak how to prioritize network traffic for certain clients, although I'd have to admit that QoS wasn't satisfactory for gaming. For example, one night I had guests over, and a single Netflix stream nuked my ping in online games. I set their client to the lowest priority and mine to the highest, which did nothing to resolve my latency issues (in excess of 500ms). Ultimately I had to use the QoS settings to cap their bandwidth at 1Mbps, which instantly resolved my latency issues.\\n\\nOther than that, this router was rock solid for nearly a year until last night it suddenly decided to reboot. When it came back online, I noticed neither 2.4 nor 5GHz bands were broadcasting anymore, and I verified that it didn't mysteriously set itself to hide SSID. I rebooted the router several times manually and through firmware before going for a firmware factory reset. Same problem, it appears the radio hardware is completely dead. Going have to send this back for a RMA.\\n\\n(Update) Without explanation, it began to broadcast on 2.4 and 5GHz channels again.

Additionally, internet speeds to 5G android devices was initially incredible (Samsung S4's), rendering network max speed connections (60mbps). Now, the speeds are down to 10% to occasionally 35% of those initial benchmarks. The LAN network file transfer speeds were remarkable in the initial evals at all ranges. Now, even those are running at 1/2 speed at best. This occurs with internet provisioning on or off (Qos).\\nThe unit is running very warm to the touch, so I don't know if heat is one of the problems. I think that heat must have a bearing on what is happening in my setup, since the initial results were so stunning compared to the Netgear equivalent products that I'd tried. Note that the router sits in the open with excellent air circulation throughout the day. My environment runs to the cool side (69 degrees max), so there is not a stressor produced by the location/condition in which I wish it to function.\\nFrankly, my trials so far have me beginning to think that too much is being asked of these leading edge devices (AC type), without sufficient consideration of an aggressive cooling solution. However, know that I am only speaking of my experience with 2 Netgear and 1 ASUS AC devices.

The firmware is familiar looking with some added features but is extremely buggy for this model. I run mostly Apple devices and it seemed that every time there was an Apple update the wireless would get extremely bad until a couple weeks later when ASUS released a firmware update to address the changes. The 5GHz band was especially bad and was more often than not unusable. When it did work it was for a brief period (an hour or so at most) and then speeds dropped to less that 1Mbps. I replaced the first unit hoping it was just defective but the second unit behaved the same way. ASUS support was absolutely no help and while they did get back to me initially within 24 hours they completely ignored my responses after that. I hate to be a conspiracy theorist but my prior dealings with ASUS support had been generally pretty positive.

If so I'll update this post. As is it was over priced for the piece of turd that it seems to be. I wish it displayed the problems within Amazon's return window. I don't expect electronics to last for ever but this is ridiculous.\\n\\nI've had this device for a year and four months. During that time I have updated the software twice. The first time had little effect, but second one about a month ago really got my hopes up. For about a week both radios consistently delivered 27 Mbps. Within a week, the 2.4GHz radio was crawling along at 10 Mbps. Occasionally it will stumble along at 2 Mbps. To me this seems like a,software problem, not something with the hardware. For a top of the line router with a $200 price tag, this shouldn't be happening.\",\n",

If you buy this router i strongly suggest flashing ASUSWRT-MERLIN. or OPENWRT. it solves 5ghz radio dropping and allows a few other bug fixes and custom tweaks. before flashing custom firmware i had to factory reset once a week to get the 5ghz band to work. this router is beast when it's tunes properly, i have 2 of these bridged and a couple of repeaters scattered around my garage and basement.

I called up tech support twice, and of course one of the first things they say to do is to reboot the router, and of course it works awesome after the reboot, so not much help there.

I subscribed to a VPN service (VyprVPN), so I'm leveraging the router's VPN client capabilities to route most of the devices in my house through a VPN (using the OpenVPN protocol) in order to protect my privacy from my ISP and to limit my ISP's ability to throttle internet speeds based on what IP addresses I'm connected to (like Sling TV, Netflix, Hulu,etc.).\\n\\nI started out using the ASUSWRT firmware (stock ASUS), but then, after some research, switched to ASUSWRT MERLIN because I needed to be able to do policy-based routing (I'm routing traffic from most of the devices on my LAN through the VPN, but have a couple I need to send out unencrypted via the WAN to my ISP). ASUSWRT MERLIN, wonderfully, has this functionality, and it's really robust --- but a huge note of caution here --- as of the writing of this review, the two most recent versions of ASUS MERLIN (380.68.2 and 380.68.0) appear to have a serious bug whereby the VPN portion of the UI irretrievably crashes as soon as you implement any policy-based routing. After a couple of hours of trying to figure out what the problem was to no avail, as a last resort I flashed version 380.67.0 onto the router and then everything worked fine. Found out later from the release notes (should have read them earlier!) there was a major redesign of the VPN portion of the UI for version 380.68.0 --- that's where the problem must have been introduced. Hopefully, this'll be addressed in a future release (they come out every month or two).\\n\\nOtherwise, this router has been great. With its dual core 1,000 Mhz processors, the VPN client using 256-bit OpenVPN encryption (with VyprVPN) has great throughput. The wireless works great, on both bands. I've got four SSIDs running -- two of these for guests (you can limit users of guest networks to internet access only, and keep them out of your intranet).

       " 'Linksys has really gone downhill. I’m in IT networking so am writing this from a technical perspective, and I couldn’t be more disappointed with this router. There are plenty of reviews that detail the failures of this product, so I won’t go into detail there. Simply put, I pay for 300mbps download from my ISP, and have a modem that can support up to 1gbps. The unreliability of this router is uncanny, and when you contact Linksys they blame your ISP, your modem, anyone but themselves. I attempted to replace the router but the issues continued. I recently purchased a mesh network router (just the router Is being used, no additional nodes are needed as my current home is less than 1200 sq. ft.) and my speeds are OVER 300 mbps download - incredible! Note that both the Linksys and new router were configured in the same manner, and I ran both speed tests off of WiFi. I’ve attached the screenshot for comparisons sake. Stay away from all Linksys products, they are a company that only care about pushing units out the door and has no interest in building a solid consumer product. Also, their app is absolutely terrible.',\n",
       " 'I never write reviews but this one inspired me. I bought this router specifically to block internet access to my kids computers. It does not work. You can \"restrict\" or block out times and the GUI says it is doing it but in reality it is not. I rebooted the router, rebooted the PC\\'s I am trying to block and they still get internet access. I even wasted time with the help desk from the Philippines, or some other outsourced non English as a first language country help desk. I even gave them control of my PC so they could adjust the settings for their admittedly \"known issue\" of parental controls not working. After wasting at least an hour on the phone with them, it still does not work. Is there any way I can invoice Linksys for my lost wages?\\n\\nSo in short, if you want to restrict internet access on certain PC\\'s, look elsewhere. Otherwise the features and accessibility are great on this router.',\n",

It was still operational and must be 10 to .15 years old,maybe older.Nonetheless with cutting the Comcast Cable I now have Amazon Fire T.V. ,Netflix,Amazon Prime video and Hulu.While watching movies it took a while for them to load up and at times that buffering effect was going on .So I figured I'd try replacing the router.Stayed with Linksys and purchased the EA6350,it has a second band at 5 ghz.The old router had only the 2.4 ghz band. That did the trick,all movies stream great now at 5ghz.The EA 6350 was a breeze to install,just followed directions and it was operational in 10 minutes.

It is the second most regrettable purchase I have ever made because of how little value it provides for the cost.\\n\\nFor $10-15 more you can buy an enterprise grade device that is even easier for a consumer to set up and has far more features.\\n\\nProblems:\\n1. No mounting slots. Are you serious? for $70 you can\\'t design a case with mounting slots?\\n2. There is no available mounting hardware. I had to make a bracket to hide it from view.\\n3. There is no documentation of the above. (because why would they document a feature they should but don\\'t have?)\\n4. The marketing materials target ignorant consumers. Here\\'s an example from the Amazon page: \"Gigabit ethernet is 10 times faster than fast ethernet.\" Okay, but let\\'s break that down. \"fast ethernet\" became broadly available to home consumers at this price point in the late 90s and Gigabit at this price point has been available to consumers since the early 2010s. In 2018, this is irrelevant fluff.\\n5. The UI is absolute junk - example: the devices list shows stale devices as being connected, even if they\\'re powered off. You have to manually flush the router, requiring a restart which is ridiculous for a device in this price range.\\n6. If you manually change the CIDR to anything less than /24 and also limit your DHCP range to less than (2^8)-2, it will erroneously assign IPs outside of its base range.\\n7. The security features (specifically, the password validation and Linksys Smart Wi-Fi account) is incredibly weak and easily compromised.\\n8. Poor upgradeability. It has had one firmware update in over two years which added minimal (passthrough) VLAN support, also with a predictably terrible UI. Also - the ddwrt/openwrt community around this is lacking because of the weak initial feature set (i.e. few people who know enough to program open source firmware bought this device) and also, fluctuations in chipset. This thing has 3 or 4 models, with 2 or 3 different chipsets, making a support path obnoxious if not virtually pointless.\\n\\nBecause of all of the above, this thing is basically a cheap linksys money maker designed to rip off ignorant consumers who think money equates to quality.',\n",

I couldn't get the Smart WIFI Web Based Setup to work, then the router started to loop and then it would randomly reset/reboot on its own. Now, I am not a network tech or even in IT but I do know my way around most electronic devices. These symptoms that others had written about were the same that I was now experiencing with this brand new router. Heck, I couldn't even make it to the setup page to try and update the firmware because of the hardware resetting/rebooting every 10-45 seconds.\\n\\nStepping back for just a moment, this reminded me of a 12v audio/computer installation that experienced similar problems/behavior. Our 12v in car PC would have instability and random reboots/random hardware failures. After many hours testing each component in the setup as well as checking each wire in the custom harness, a ROOKIE, yes a ROOKIE got his multimeter out and tested the source power (where the harness was hooked to the battery/distribution box) and the destination connections (where the harness lead into the car PC) and as it turns out, the voltage was below 10V, causing us to realize that we used the wrong gauge wire. We essentially used the bare minimum wire for the installation and whenever the in car PC would have a load on it (cold boot), the voltage would drop just enough to cause issues. We beefed up the power line considerably and all was well after that.\\n\\nWhy the heck do I write a router review that includes a story about a 12v car PC? Cause the same problem is here:\\n\\nThe Linksys label on the bottom of the router calls for a 12v 2a power supply. I checked the power supply that this NEW router came with and low and behold, the darn thing is rated for 12v 0.5a. This router will NEVER work properly without the correct power supply. I got a power supply from my LED strip parts bin that was rated for 12v 3.0a and plugged it in (same barrel connector). The router immediately came online, downloaded its updated firmware immediately and went online within 1 minute. I have only had this router for two hours since the power supply was corrected and I have had NO issues as of yet.\\n\\nTo all of the folks that still have this router and are having any intermittent connectivity issues or having setup issues, check the power supply label and see if it is 12v 2.0a or higher. If it is not, replace it and hopefully that will solve your issues. Keep in mind that you may need to complete a factory reset with the new power supply and go through the setup process (as noted in the forums and manuals). If your router still is NOT working after correcting the power supply and redoing the factory reset & setup, then you may truly have a defective unit.\",\n",

       " 'If you would like to get ethernet speeds on a wireless router, you can stop looking now: Linksys AC3200 Tri-Band Smart Wi-Fi Router. I live in a heavily populated area with several businesses (apartment). I wanted to replace my old router that only had 10/100 ethernet ports (WD MyNet N600 - A real POS). I also wanted to \"future proof\" myself at least 5 years.\\n\\nI have a Plex Media Server that I stream to an iPad 2, MacBook Pro 2011, and to the Plex for Android app on a Samsung Galaxy S3. Using ANY of these devices locally, there is absolutely NO LAG watching 1080p 32GB blu-ray rips.\\n\\nThe range is incredible if assuming no industrial walls are in the way. I have a decent connection ~8mbps when I am across the parking lot ~300 feet from router.\\n\\nThe USB 3.0 port is nice when I need to quickly share data with others on my network (sorry did not have a USB3.0 device to test transfer speed). I had a USB2.0 device that transferred at 60Mbps approximate which is pretty good.\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Great for upgrading old N and older routers\\n2. Perfect for densely populated areas like apartment complexes\\n3. FAST\\n4. Two USB ports\\n5. One 2.4GHz network @ 600mbps and Two 5 GHz networks @ 1.3gbps\\n6. Can have 1 - 3 Network ID\\'s, I suggest having just the same SSID on all 3 (easier to remember 1 password than 3!)\\n\\n**EDIT:**\\nNumber 6 originally was: \"Can have 3 network ID\\'s, 2 ID\\'s, or just 1 - which I highly recommend doing and let the router choose the best option for you!\"\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Has a stand and must sit upright (cannot \"lie flat\")\\n2. Slightly larger than expected (potential eye sore - mine is hidden so not a big deal to me)\\n\\n********************************\\nUpdate: 03/24/2017 -\\n\\nI had begun to notice that almost all of my iDevices (iPad 2, iPhone 5s, iPhone SE) were getting \"dropped\". I want to expand this a little bit. What I mean when I say \"dropped\" is that each device says that they were connected to WiFi, but no webpages or anything that required the internet would load. These devices need the 40MHz band to function and the Smart Band Connect steering would sometimes (for lack of a better term here) \"drop\" these clients. After going into WiFi settings, turned Smart Connect to Off, I made the 2.4GHz band Mixed/Auto/Auto (Network mode/Channel/Channel width), 5GHz1 to 802.11ac only/36 - 5.180GHz/80MHz, and 5GHz2 to 802.11ac only/161 - 5.805GHz/40MHz.\\n\\nAfter doing this, all my iDevices go to 5GHz2 and no longer have the \"drop\" problem. I hope this helps any other potential buyer/anyone that is having connection issues.\\n\\nSome additional resources on this router. I am on Firmware 1.1.9.176400 (which does NOT show up if you click check for updates). I use Port Forwarding, VPN passthrough is Enabled, Firewall is enabled for both IPv4 and IPv6, I turned Internet Filters of multicast and Internal NAT redirect off, IPv6 is enabled, and Guest network is turned Off.\\n\\nStill 5 stars because this router is incredible!',\n",
       " 'Pros: I liked that it had two USB ports for external storage.\\nCons: Constantly needed to be rebooted. Consistently would lose LAN (local area network) connections. Never had an up time longer than two weeks. Died today (installed only eight months ago) in the middle of a client appointment. Very unhappy with this product. UPDATE. Contacted Linksys technical support. Spent over an hour updating firmware, rebooting, and resetting. Tech decided (finally) that the router needed to be replaced. I have to pay for shipping both ways. There is no option for a refund. Good News: The new NETGEAR router purchased as a replacement is running faster than the Linksys ever did and no rebooting constantly.',\n",
       " 'I should have read the multiple negative reviews on this, I thought they were just the exception to the rule. I am having the same problems as just about every other negative review here... connected devices just drop out. My MacPro gets a connection and drops it every 5 to 7 minutes. My iPhone 7 was getting 60 mb/sec download (on 100 mb download service plan cable modem) when it did work, now it won\\'t even connect. All the devices show connected on the Linksys Smart Wifi network map, but none are actually connected to internet. I\\'m not looking forward to being run through all the \"please restart your modem and router\" crap from tech support, and yes I have the latest firmware. I\\'ve re-botted and reinstalled the firmware more than once including a full reset to factory and re-set up. Still the same results. Had this route for 8 days as of this review and if I can\\'t get it sorted I will return this item. If I can figure out what the issue is I will upgrade this review.\\n*** Edit, 3 weeks after purchase **** After almost returning this item I got tech support on the phone. As it turns out my firmware was not the latest version. If you look in the LinksysSmartWifi portal and check for updates it will NOT tell you that your firmware is out of date, you need to go the Linksys website, click support, find your router, and then click firmware. From there I could see I did not have the latest firmware. So after updating that the tech also had me change the name of the 5.0 ghz band by adding _5 to the network name, so the 2.4 an 5 ghz network names are not the same. Also on the 2.4 ghz network options we took the channel off of auto and put it on 6, and the channel width was set to 20MHZ only. This seems to have solved my issues and all my devices are running very fast on wireless and not getting booted off.',\n",
       " 'Ok, where to start....\\n\\nFirst one lasted 5 months or so before it stopped working. Could no longer access user interface over ethernet, the Easy Tether feature of this router (only reason I bought it) no longer worked. I tried new cables, multiple firmware versions, hard and soft resets on the router, hard and soft resets on the phone, trying a different phone. Nothing, zip, nada, router was toast. IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS SPECFICALLY TO USE EASY TETHER and bypass tethering restrictions you should know that this is a poorly implemented feature in this router. It requires a lengthy setup and if you don\\'t understand some basics of linux you will have a bad time, although the instructions from the company are ok. Even once you get it setup, easytether will randomly just disapear from the network interfaces list requiring a complete router reset and reinstall to get it back. It will drop the connection randomly requiring you to unplug and re plug your phone also, although that may be a cellular network issue.\\n\\nTech support (the first time) consisted of a software engineer emailing me to say \"please reset router\" after I wrote an email stating I had done that 10+ times, flashed firmware multiple times, tried different cords and phones etc. I couldn\\'t believe it. The SECOND time I reached out to them, tech support offered to trouble shoot over team viewer, something I couldnt do because I needed a functioning router to get internet access. The customer service was pretty great throughout and the lady that handles that part is really on top of things.\\n\\nAlso, re: easy tether, once it actually is functioning the stock UI shows no indication it is connected (but ironically if you open a browser it is) and as such you cannot use the built in VPN feature since it requires the UI to recognize a connection to work.....so that feature is basically useless too in this situation. You can use DDWRT only firmware and it is recognized this way but it is much more complicated to use than the stock user interface.\\n\\nSo, they were good about sending me a new router when I asked for one, they paid for return shipping as well as it was still in its 1 year warranty.\\n\\nThe SECOND router worked great for about a week and then it also stopped working. With this one, the repeater feature for WIFI just quit. The next day the easytether feature also quit and just disapeared from the interface list in LuCi. Reset router multiple times, reflashed firmware etc. Again, functionality never returned. Finally, I flashed the DDWRT only firmware from the companies website and the router just bricked. This is a firmware I had successfully flashed before on the first router so the files were good. Second router now just has one light come on and never boots. I ran the \"debrick\" guide that the company published and even after using it, router still would not boot.\\n\\nI believe these routers are attempting to do more than they can and that lack the technical support to implement all the features they advertise. I was a heavy user, often using this router for weeks 24/7, so maybe they just arent meant to handle that.\\n\\nIf you visit the forums for this company you see lots of people having lots of different problems.\\n\\nI would stay away from these routers if you are looking for anything other than occasional use and doing things like repeating the starbucks or hotel wifi to make your own secure network. It\\'s too bad too because there aren\\'t any other routers that I know of in this price range that use OpenWRT and let you tether with Easy Tether to bypass tethering restrictions. However, if you do decide to go this route you can be sure customer service will address any concerns you have.\\n\\nUPDATE: Sent the second one back and the company refunded me my purchase price. They state they are going to look into the easy tether problems and make sure it is better implemented before the send me another one. Probably will not be buying one again, but at least I got all my money back.',\n",
       " \"I bought this intending to use this in a hotel to connect all my devices when I travel. I haven't used it there yet, but my initial setup has given me a little insight into how it will run.\\n\\nI had planned to just use a raspberry pi for the whole package, meaning, connect to wifi at hotel, provide a wireless access point behind a router, and vpn to my home to encrypt traffic. For now, getting all that configured on a raspberry pi is beyond me, unfortunately. This router will fill the void by giving me my own access point, and tunneling it to my house using OpenVPN. The raspberry pi allows me to use the web browser to connect to any wifi source, and then allow it to be shared out the onboard lan.\\n\\nThe only downside I noticed in my initial tests was that while connecting to the 5 Ghz wireless while the VPN was active, I could not play back a video on my chromecast without it pausing and buffering every few seconds. Switching to the 2.4 Ghz wireless was fine. Maybe browsing the internet, etc, would have worked, but video streaming did not.\\n\\nEspecially for the size, this packs all I need into a travel router. It is just about the same size as my raspberry pi. I will be trying this out in the wild fairly soon, and can update on what my experience is then.\",\n",
       " \"My primary reason for buying this was to provide an isolated LAN in hotel rooms on a trip to China. Secondary to that was to try to provide a VPN tunnel out of China. For both these purposes this unit worked flawlessly.\\n\\nThe ramp-up time to get getting this set-up was a little steep, but I didn't have any specific difficulties with getting it up and running or getting VPN profiles on it to work and connect to the OpenVPN supporting tunnel end points.\\n\\nAs another review has noted, the unit has a low-power CPU. As such, it supports VPN tunnels, but not at full bandwidth. I've seen throughput of about 2Mbit in the tunnel. When VPN is turned off, I've seen throughput of 50-60Mbit. I'm not clear if the slight drop from directly talking to the WiFi access point is due to the router being slow, or if it is just inherent in the extra buffering, or if the extra radio traffic in the same band is causing interference that is slowing down the connection. Regardless, for my intended purpose, this worked great. I didn't want the VPN access in the router to allow me to stream Netflix, I wanted to be able to access websites in the US and my email and messages without the traffic going through China servers if I could avoid it. I also wanted to avoid having information leak into the local WAN and anything between the hotel WANs and the US in China.\\n\\nIf I wanted to stream video to a device, I'd look at routing around the tunnel in the router and running the VPN client on a more powerful processor--e.g. on my iphone, ipad, or laptop--for that traffic.\\n\\nFor the price, and for the functionality, I'm very happy with this purchase. I think they've done a good job of hitting a nice compromise between functionality and power constraints for the device. I am happy that I can run it off the USB port on my laptop. (I'm actually using it now, as I write this review, from a cafe.)\",\n",

       " 'The UI with for router is superior to the TP-Link. It is a few dollars more but well worth the price for the extra features, stability and UI. The GL iNet router saves networks you’ve used previously and makes for a much easier connection. I spoke directly with TP-Link and they confirmed, I had to reset their router, down to the admin password, in order to connect to a new or previously used network. So each time, I had to push a pen into the little reset button, hold it for several seconds, assign a new admin password and then run through the quick setup process. Also note, the text and screen size for the TP-Link UI does not optimize for mobile phone, so you’ll be shrinking, expanding and swiping to get the links you need to get it set up. Little annoyance I know but still, they should check the box that optimizes the text and screen layout.\\n\\nThe GL iNet router gives the option to save the network, so when you show up at the same hotel or coffee shop, it will connect quite easily without needing to reset it back to factory defaults.. LAN inputs and a micro SD also make this a much better value than the TP-Link product.\\n\\nOne more thing: It will automatically reconnect to a saved network also.. Unlike the TP-Link router.

       " 'Was traveling to China and was very concerned about getting hacked. Wanted a travel router that had OpenVPN loaded so I could turn on and use my VPN subscription when needed. General Google and internet searches didn’t turn up many options but I found this one on Amazon and decided to give it a try. The price was good and it came with open source DD-WRT and openVPN preloaded. Using this does require some basic knowledge of network security and isn’t for those who typically can’t manage these settings without assistance.\\n\\nThe device worked flawlessly. It was easy to set-up my third party VPN account in the software. It easily connects to secure and public WiFi without any issues. For IOS users that have problems with getting the login page of public WiFi to show up, using this router gets around this IOS problem. An unexpected bonus.\\n\\nAnother unexpected bonus was the fact that this router can run off micro-USB power. It doesn’t require its own specific power supply. This allows it to run off a standard USB battery pack, so you can use it without an outlet. When originally looking for a travel router, I was hoping to find a battery-powered travel router with OpenVPN, but could not find one. However, I now prefer this one because it is much smaller in size than battery powered travel router, and allows me to easily run it off a usb battery pack if I need to. It’s the best of both worlds since I always have a few battery packs with me when traveling.',\n",

Essentially, our network remains isolated from the other guests while delivering to us an networked intranet with internet access.\\n\\nPro tip: make sure to only update firmware using a wired connection. We performed it wirelessly and bricked the device. I was able to resolve easily enough (hard resets would not recover firmware) by simply connecting an ethernet adapter to my computer and running a length of ethernet cable to one of the LAN ports on the router. I then manually connected to the router (manually defining my computer's IP address and gateway IP address) to upload the firmware (you can download for GL.iNet website).\\n\\nAfter some initial hiccups the router is running a google chromecast network for audio and TV while serving 3 iPhones, a kindle fire, a couple of chromebooks, and a Macbook.

I was able to double up the wifi internet speed instantly in the far corner of my living room. TCL wifi apps was well structured and user friendly. Very happy with the purchase.\\n\\nBonus Note: I also installed TCL Wifi Mesh AC1200 as wifi booster, instead of a wifi router, by plugging the the provided gigabit ethernet cable to my old wifi router.

       " 'The important update: Yes, I have connected to Verizon 4G LTE service with this device. It works on Verizon, with a Verizon SIM card (nano size). A few quick notes, then the longer saga is below:\\n\\n1) You will want the IMEI (device ID) from the box the router comes in (on a sticker with the serial number etc.).\\n2) Verizon would not let me use a SIM card that was already activated for another hotspot. I had to get a new SIM card from Verizon to make this work.\\n3) After ordering the SIM card from Verizon, I then had to contact Verizon to activate the SIM card. I needed the SIM card number (ID, or ICC ID) and the IMEI from the router.\\n4) Once the SIM card was properly activated, the router connected to Verizon 4G LTE with default settings, no username or password, no changes to APN or other settings. I did restart the LTE connection through the router interface; turning the router off and on again should work fine too (in order to make it retry a connection that had failed on its first try, before Verizon activated the card).\\n5) Until the SIM card worked, it was hard to connect to the router using the Nighthawk app or a wired connection if there was any SIM card in the router. You\\'re better off connecting with no SIM card in the router until you have activated the SIM card you\\'re going to use.\\n\\nMy whole goal with this router is to have a router that automatically switches to a 4G LTE Internet connection as a backup when my main Internet connection fails. Other than that, it\\'s just another router. The 4G LTE connection is what differentiates this router.\\n\\nAnd it works, and the setup is actually very simple. I would say 2/3 of the problem was on Verizon\\'s side, not letting me use a Verizon SIM card I already had. I understand why Verizon does this. Easily 1/3 of the difficulty was that Netgear did not give simple instructions for how to connect to Verizon using a Verizon SIM card. Their device will do it, perfectly fine. If they had included a card with instructions, I would have saved literally hours of experimenting to figure out where the problem was. Once I set up the Verizon card right, the router just worked.\\n\\nMore hints and tips can be found in the story below.\\n\\nFirst impression: In 5 places in the description, Amazon clearly said this was Verizon compatible, licensed with Verizon, Verizon tested, etc. But when I opened the box, a sticker on the shrink wrap clearly said this was not compatible with Verizon. (Another online store says it\\'s not compatible with Verizon. Netgear\\'s site says it is not compatible with Verizon, but they\\'re working on it.)\\n\\nThis is important for anyone considering the product. No matter what the description says, think twice if you plan to use it on Verizon.\\n\\nFurther notes: This uses a Nano SIM card, not the next size up. The old Netgear product that I\\'m hoping this will replace (also on Verizon, also not officially authorized, but it works fine) used a larger SIM card. I got a SIM card trimmer from Amazon and fixed that. Most SIM cards you buy new these days will come in multiple sizes, so less of an issue.\\n\\nI will update the review more as I determine real-world compatibility.\\n\\nUPDATE 1: The Quick Start guide inside the box, face up lying on top of the router itself, gives three steps to setup: 1) Download Nighthawk app (iOS or Android), 2) Install the app (which will ask you to sign up for a Netgear account), 3) Use the app to set up the router. Here\\'s the hitch: When you run the app, and it connects to the router, it tells you that the app does not support this router model. End of setup. Nothing further is allowed.\\n\\nThis is a Nighthawk router, branded as such on the box. Netgear\\'s Web page that lists router models compatible with the Nighthawk app does not list this model (LAX20) as of April 18 2021.\\n\\nI suspect the app will be updated, and then things will work. But this is unfortunate with a new product. The router seems cleanly designed and appears to have a lot of thought put into it. But the marketers at Netgear should not have claimed it was compatible with Verizon if it wasn\\'t, and they should not have included that card in the box if the app hadn\\'t been updated yet to recognize this new router model.\\n\\nMoving along: On the Netgear site, you can download a User Manual for the router. This offers two or three other ways to link to the router and set it up, similar to the setup routine for every other router I have ever set up. So far, it looks like no big deal.\\n\\nUPDATE 2: Plugged in router to wired network, and connected to it using Ethernet rather than wi-fi. Still a problem: If you put in a SIM that doesn\\'t work, the router gets hung up on that step of setup and won\\'t let you go to the rest of setup. So I took out the SIM I had put in, and I was able to set up the router using the instructions from the manual I downloaded from Netgear\\'s site. A couple of things were a little flaky or confused at first, but it sorted itself out. Router works fine, as a router (wired: I haven\\'t experimented with wi-fi yet).\\n\\nThe router will not connect to Verizon so far, but let\\'s be fair: Verizon may be (probably is, according to Verizon) blocking the SIM from connecting when it\\'s plugged into a new device. This is to protect Verizon customers. Verizon is able to check to make sure the SIM is authorized (it is, and it works in its original device), but it also can check whether the IMEI (the ID number) of the new router is the one that\\'s authorized for this account (it\\'s not). So I have ordered a new SIM card from Verizon and activated this IMEI as a new line. I will update this further when that arrives.\\n\\nBut: Amazon says this router is Verizon compatible. The sticker on the shrink wrap says it\\'s not. When I go to Verizon\\'s site and give Verizon the IMEI (on the outside of the box), Verizon says that this device will work with Verizon, and it recognizes it as the correct model number of router. So Verizon so far agrees with the Amazon marketing, not the sticker on the shrink wrap.\\n\\nPossibly some settings will need to be adjusted too. Can\\'t tell till the new SIM card gets here.\\n\\nUPDATE 3: New SIM card arrived. Popped it in. Restarted router. No joy. Phoned Netgear. Spoke to 3 separate operators in a 75-minute phone call. None of them really seemed to understand the issue. The one who was most savvy talked fast and didn\\'t listen much. He at least understood how networks function. The others were reading scripts. In the end, after restarting, resetting, reconnecting, when Verizon still was not connected, he said, \"So there are no issues remaining, right?\" or words to that effect.\\n\\nI\\'ll call Verizon in the morning to make sure the SIM card is correctly activated.\\n\\nUPDATE 4: (see notes above. Yes, Verizon activated the SIM card correctly, and the router started working.)\\n\\nNow that I have set it up, I\\'ll update this review again and add some stars, depending on how it runs in regular use. There have been some serious issues with the way the product is presented, but if it runs, it runs. By connecting to Verizon 4G LTE, it has started doing what I bought it for and what it was advertised to do.\\n\\nFor the record, I\\'ve had other Netgear products, and I\\'ve been happy with them. (I\\'m using one to post this review.) I have nothing against the company. (I also have nothing against Amazon. I hate to say how many thousands of dollars a year I spend on Amazon.) So I have no axe to grind here about Netgear as a company. I\\'m just trying to provide useful information for anyone considering this product, or anyone who has it and is trying to make it work.',\n",

I connected an old Motorola G Play phone to the router via USB tethering. Because this router runs openwrt, I was able to go to firewall custom rules and enter the iptables entries to set TTL 65 (look it up). Then, for my old Moto G Play phone, I ran \"settings put global tether_dun_required 0\" in adb shell; I should\\'ve done this as the last step as I\\'m not sure if this step is needed or not. Finally I edited the APN type on the phone to add \",dun\" to the list.

The router signal is better than the hotspot so I can have just one signal, with no need for a repeater. The WAN port can be used as a LAN port, allowing for two LAN connections. I love the simplicity, and the graphical view of network choices and settings.\\n\\nThe seller was great, the product works great. But, what could be wrong? Nowhere in the description or user guide does it mention the use of Firefox or Chrome as the browser required for setup of this router. Internet Explorer is not able to modify wireless settings.

But because we'd just bought all new equipment through Amazon, we were sure the problem was on the ISP end.\\n\\nIt wasn't. It was this router. The technician showed us that when he unplugged the router and instead connected our machine directly through WAN, we had internet access again. The problem is definitely the router. And we don't have the time to do even more troubleshooting to see IF we can determine what the problem with the router is.\\n\\nSo now we're out the cost of this router, the $149 for the tech visit, and we have to spend more cash on a reputable router instead because we're past the 30-day return window. Of course. We're pissed. We're sick of buying junk technology that has issues that manifest JUST after the 30-day return window.\\n\\n***********************************************************************************************************************************************************\\nFor the price, this is turning out to be a great little router.

Since I intended to use the router as an access point, I tried AP-mode first, but I noticed a few restrictions of AP-mode: Router LEDs can\\'t be turned off and you can\\'t disable WPS (a potential security risk), because the corresponding menu entries are not available in AP-mode.\\n\\nAs a consequence of these limitations of AP-mode I am running the device in router mode and configured it manually to work as an access point. I am loosing certain features (obtain router time automatically, obtain firmware upgrades automatically), but for me it\\'s worth the extra hassle of setup and maintenance.\\n\\nBased on the first 24 hours or operation, I am very happy with my purchase so far:\\n- The Wifi range is very good and very stable, no connectivity issues. In fact I did lower the radio power from high to medium and still have very good connectivity for the devices in my environment.\\n- I\\'m pleased with the speed, it is fast enough for my needs.\\n- Since the device is in our bedroom, it\\'s great to be able to turn off the LEDs at night on a time schedule.\\n\\nWhat I\\'d like to see improved:\\n- Built-in AP-mode needs to be enhanced to provide LED control and WPS mode control (as well as other relevant settings that I might have missed).\\n- It would be great to turn off the Wifi radio on a schedule.\\n\\nDeducting 1/2 a star for the minor firmware limitations in AP mode (see above), I\\'m giving this device 4.5 stars, rounding up to 5 stars and I\\'m hoping that the device will stay as reliable going forward as it\\'s been for the first day.\\n\\nA site note on how to configure this router to run as an access point in router mode , if you don\\'t want to use the built-in AP mode (as always this info is given without accepting any liability for any problems or damages as a result of following the information. If at some point you can\\'t connect to the device anymore, perform a factory reset and start over):\\n\\n1. Look at your main router and note it\\'s internal IP address as well as the number range of the internal DHCP service. If for example the router\\'s internal IP address is 192.168.x.1 and it\\'s DHCP service starts using numbers from 192.168.x.100 then the numbers 192.168.x.2 to 192.168.x.99 are free for static IP address assignments. (Note that \"x\" stands for a number between 0 and 255), for most routers it is 1, but I\\'ve seen it to be 0 or 10 as well. Look at your router\\'s internal IP address to get the value of x). Let\\'s assume x=1. Now with the assumptions above we pick any number that isn\\'t yet in use (by the router, the DHCP service or another device on your network). Let\\'s say we pick 20, so the static IP-address to use would be 192.168.1.20.\\n(Wow, that was the hard part...)\\n\\n2. Power on your Archer C7. Don\\'t connect it to your main router, yet! But connect to it from your computer (via a cable to a LAN port) or via Wifi.\\n\\n3. Give the router a new password (and write that password down!).\\n\\n4. You start in Quick setup mode. Press \"Exit\" to cancel this mode and then click on the \"Advanced\" tab on top of the page. Please note that being in Advanced mode is the prerequisite for the following steps.\\n\\n5. Click on \"Network -> DHCP server\", uncheck the option \"Enable DHCP server\" and click \"Save\". Do NOT rebot your router, yet!!!\\n\\n6. Click on \"Network -> LAN\" and enter the static IP-address, we determined in step 1. (e.g. 192.168.1.20) in our example. Leave the subnet mask at 255.255.255.0 and click \"Save\".\\n\\n7. The router will reboot now automatically. (That\\'s the reason why we did step 5 before step 6, because they need to happen in one swoop.)\\n\\n8. Now connect the LAN (!) port of your C7 to your main router. The WAN port cannot be used anymore, so do not plug in anything into that port.\\n\\n9. The tplinkwifi symbolic device name may no longer be available to connect to the configuration portal, so instead use the statis IP-address from step #1 in the browser address bar to connect to the web interface ( in my example: 192.168.1.20 )\\n\\n10. You have to configure the router time (System Tools -> Time Settings) manually and you can turn off WPS under (System Tools -> System Parameters). (Once again please note that you have to be in Advanced mode to do this).\\n\\n11. The built-in firmware upgrade check (System Tools -> Firmware upgrade) also doesn\\'t work in this configuration, so be sure to check the manufacturer\\'s website every couple of months (or after major router vulnerabilities have been published).',\n",
       " \"This router arrived in Sep. 2017 but regularly stopped working, needing a reboot, starting within 24 hours of use. After about six times of needing a restart, and checking the modem and other potential problems, I finally gave up. Besides the complete stoppages, the router appeared to freeze up temporarily several times, stopping internet delivery several times. Although it was recommended in some places, after I purchased and started using this router, I noticed that several other people had a similar problem with their router needing frequent restarts. I was disappointed since it's a pain to go through all this, and the signal easily covered our entire house and yard at the 2.4 GHz frequency and most of the house inside at the 5 GHz frequency. Set up of the computers and phones to the wifi was easy, although I never did figure out how to get the printer installed as a plug-in to the router. The bandwidth through this router was somewhat better than an ancient c.2003 Linksys router I compared it to.\\n\\nI replaced the TP-Link Archer C7 with a (more expensive) Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 (R7000) router. Although the initial setup of the Netgear router was much more complicated and time-consuming, the performance of the Netgear router is dramatically superior so far. All devices work at least as well and some much, much better; after experiencing the smooth, fast performance of the Netgear router, I would never want to use this TP-Link router. While the range of both routers were excellent and similar at 2.4 GHz, the Netgear covers the entire house at 5 GHz and even halfway down the block. I'll summarize our experience with several devices tested:\\n\\niPhone 7 and SE: both worked well with TP-Link, old Linksys, and new Netgear. Netgear slightly superior\\n\\nhigh end but two year old Samsung tablet: the performance with the new Netgear router is phenomenally faster than the TP Link or old Linksys\\n\\nWindows 7 Sony laptop purchased 2009: the Netgear router is smoother and the laptop doesn't heat up fast with heavy bandwidth use like it did with TP-Link (this was quite a surprise to me, but I've checked it out a fair bit)\\n\\nWindows 10 desktop with SSD. The measured bandwidth is best with the Netgear and the observed performance is much faster and more reliable with the Netgear than the TP Link or old Linksys (the performance of the latter two were indistinguishable or the old Linksys was better)\\n\\nMac Book Air laptop: The performance with the Netgear is the best of the three. This laptop has worked great with wifi across the US, Europe, and South America essentially everywhere except with this TP-Link router where it frequently just froze up for a few minutes at a time, as the TP Link router did with all connected devices.\",\n",
       " \"To put this review in perspective, I am an IT professional with over 30 years experience and most of that has been focused on network infrastructure. Over the years I've watched TP-link evolve from low-end network cards into a good player in SOHO gear. This product is not on par with what it should be for the price, and the product support is lacking.\\n\\nThe issues I've had is that the device doesn't work half the time, and the unreliability seems to be tied to whether the 5ghz band is turned on. I thought it was just me our I got a defective unit, but this is a common issue with the archer c7. The bottom line is, I paid for a dual band wireless router but it really only works in single band 2ghz mode.\\n\\nI've waited patiently for the firmware update to come to address this problem, but in the 7 months I've waited there has been no update. There is no excuse for not releasing firmware updates. There have to be bugs or security issues that need to be patched. No firmeware updates means they are done worth this product, and what you have you live with.\\n\\nI was hoping to install dd-wrt as a plan B, but dd-wrt won't run on this model unless you remove the 5ghz card internally.\\n\\nSounds like the 5ghz card is lacking quality Linux drivers. This is probably the underlying reason the 5ghz band makes the device unreliable.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the 2ghz band transmit and re is he is much stronger than my other 2ghz wireless access points.\\n\\nUPDATE: The device is compatible with dd-wrt, and I was able to install and all issues resolved. As long as you have hardware revision 2 or higher, you can dump the stock firmware and install DD-WRT. The good news is that all the issues I was seeing are gone now with DD-WRT. Thus I have raised my rating from two stars to three. That being said, you shouldn't have to dump stock firmware to get a stable working device.\\n\\nAlso, the issues I was seeing were likely because I am not using the WAN port. I have a pfsense firewall that my broadband internet connects and which provides firewall services. Thus, my wireless router is used simply as access points as a bridge. It would appear that the stock firmware doesn't handle this configuration well.\\n\\nUpdated: 7/10/2017 -- I wanted to circle back to report that after flashing with DD-WRT a few weeks ago, this router is rock-solid in stability and performance. I am revising the title of this review to reflect that, but not increasing the stars given because the customer should not have to spend time and ultimately replace the firmware to get a stable product. Clearly, the issues I was experiencing had nothing to do with hardware, which means the factory firmware should have worked.\\n\\nBy the way, yes I did re-flash the firmware with the image from TP-Link to be sure it wasn't just corrupter somehow, and issues remained.\",\n",
       " 'I found this router through a third party website review (the Wire Cutter), that aptly called this, \"the Best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People).\" I would probably amend that title and say, \"the Best Wi-Fi Router (for Virtually Everyone).\" Do not let the low price fool you into thinking it\\'s an entry level or low-end model. It only costs around $100 but, from my observations against four other routers that cost considerably more, it performs well beyond its price point.\\n\\nI have purchased a number of routers over the years as the technology and performance improves, and the number of devices my family uses has increased. Over the past few years, I had migrated to the more expensive ($300+) routers in the hopes of greater performance. Right before this, I had an Asus RT-AC5300, a beast of a router that exceeded $400 when I bought it. But what I found was that as the price point goes up, the performance does not, and the reliability goes down. These expensive routers tend to be buggy and drop connections; they simply have too many features and are way too complex, all to provide functionalities that no one uses, or that none of your connected devices support anyway. The ASUS got so bad it was rebooting itself every few hours. The days of the rock-solid Linksys WRT54G seemed long gone... So I returned the ASUS RT-AC5300, gave my WRT1900ACS to a friend, and bought an Archer C7 (v2).\\n\\nAfter two weeks of testing it, I have four words: it just works -- period. The signal is strong and punches through the lathe-and-plaster walls of my nearly 100 year old house. Its signal is considerably stronger than the WRT1900ACS that I had (which cost almost three times what this one did), and rivaled the signal strength of the $400 ASUS. It doesn\\'t drop connections, doesn\\'t reboot itself, and delivers a strong and steady stream of data to all devices, wired and wireless.\\n\\nOnly one word of warning; you need to make sure the Archer C7 that you purchase is NOT a first version. Everyone on the web has reported that TP-LINK badly botched the V1, especially for Macintosh/Apple devices (which is most of my house); most of those should be out of circulation or in landfills by now. The one I bought from Amazon was a V2, and it works perfectly with all of my Apple and non-Apple devices.',\n",
       " \"What a miserable experience I had trying to set this horrible router up.\\n\\nI'm fairly tech literate...last little TP Link I bought five or so years ago was a breeze to set up via the web utility. I was so happy with that that I decided to go with TP Link again for my next router purchase. Apparently I made a big mistake.\\n\\nThis thing doesn't want to find the web utility, and doesn't want to configure either 2.4 or the 5GHz networks properly.\\n\\nSeveral times during the process I was told I couldn't connect to the TP Link site, but then when I refreshed the browser it seemed to get in, even though it also said I had no internet connection.\\n\\nThe directions aren't clear...I tried to set a new password for both networks and then at some point I was told I had to use the default numeric password that comes with the device.\\n\\nTwice during the process I was told in the TP Link website that I needed to contact support...but the number was not given with the error message, and I couldn't find it in the site. Sometimes I could navigate to other pages in the TP Link site, and other times it would just spin up and never get me anywhere new.\\n\\nI could never connect to anything other than the TP Link admin/cloud site, and barely that.\\n\\nNOT a straightforward process at all. Very, very confusing. I am on a large, common cable ISP, and never had these problems with my other router. I think I may go ahead and bundle this POC back up in the box and return it. It shouldn't be this hard for the technologically literate to set up a wifi router.\\n\\nIf I decide to call tech support I may update. But my review will probably still stand, even if I call and can get it working properly. My comments are on the set up process right out of the box, and having to call tech support is a BIG STRIKE against any device I buy.\\n\\nAfter reading more of the 1 star reviews I fully expect TP Link to contact me in these comments and reference the MAC Cloning issue. But I must ask them: if someone needs to clone the MAC address, then WHY ISN'T THAT MADE CLEAR IN THE SET UP PROCESS?\\n\\nAfter reading about the MAC clone issue I *almost* went back and tried that. But I decided against it. IME any device that has given me this many problems right out of the box isn't likely to give me a rewarding, reliable experience going forward.\\n\\nTP Link seems to have lost their mojo, and also this customer.\\n\\nBuyer beware.\",\n",
       " 'I had high hopes when I bought this router to upgrade from my ISPs provided WiFi. I looked around and read all of the reviews and decided the TP-Link Archer C7 was the one. I chose it because it was dual band supporting both 2.4 Ghz and 5GHz, seemed to have good reviews, and a reasonable price. I was excited when I took it out of the package because it just looks more substantial than the junk my ISP supplies. I set it up adding it to my network and disabled the WiFi on my ISPs equipment. I connected all the various devices in my house to the 5GHz network. A lot of my devices are newer and already supported 5Ghz. I had a few devices still on 2.4 Ghz and I connected them the the 2.4 Ghz network. Everything seemed to be good for a few days. Then the lost connectivity started happening on various devices. Sometimes devices would work fine, then start to lose connectivity. The entire 5Ghz network would seem to drop out of existence and no device could see it. At other times the 2.4 Ghz network would drop out and could not be seen. Each time the only cure was a reboot of the TP-Link to restore connectivity. I am an IT guy with 20 years experience in the business. I am the guy everyone calls to troubleshoot and fix their tech. I have done everything short of sending the device back for a refund to try and make this router more stable. When it works, it is super fast and life is good. Then seemingly at random, things go south and a reboot is the only cure. I know that this is a piece of consumer grade equipment and I shouldn\\'t expect it to perform like a business grade piece of equipment that costs 20x more money. However this thing frustrates the crap out of me anyway. I am very close to writing a script to reboot the router nightly when no one uses it.

The app is even the most user-friendly app I’ve ever used after setup — using WPS to add devices is a breeze, checking router status and upload/download speed is also a very simple process. Though a little pricier than a regular, non-mesh router, the ease of use and the WiFi signal are two reasons to choose mesh over a regular router. This is definitely a highly recommended product!',\n",
       " \"When we first bought our condo, I bought the same Nighthawk router I experienced success with at another home. Sadly, even with adding a Netgear extender, it could not cover our relatively small (1200 sq ft) condo well. At our old home, I would get signal outside 500ft away while I was mowing the lawn and streaming music. The condo is brick and plaster construction, and outside of the room the router was in, coverage was spotty at best. I could barely get a signal less than 30ft away from the router, and the extender didn't help much at all.\\n\\nI did lots of research and decided on the M5. The price was right, and I chose not to go with the M9 as I didn't want it seeing or trying to control my ZigBee devices on my Iris Hub. Setup was not perfect; discovery has to fail twice before you are given to option to connect to each additional router via bluetooth. However, the end result is nothing short of spectacular. I now have full signal strength in every corner of the condo; I especially like how I can prioritize those devices that are most important for better connections.\\n\\nI'm not sure if it would have been necessary, but I did add a fourth router so there would be one in every bedroom and one in the main living/dining/kitchen area. It may seem like a bit of overkill, but this is the first time I've been able to count on WiFi working everywhere in our home, so I'm not changing a thing!\",\n",

       " \"I've setup and used the Netgear ORBI mesh product, not as easy as a classic router but works OK after a couple of days. The TP-Link Deco looks intriguing and is a lower cost. Setup and performance is terrible. First, there is no manual, just a QR code that takes you to a Google Playstore app. Don't buy this product if you don't have a smart phone! Got the app, and now I have to login. Login? I don't have a TP-Link login. Maybe it needs an email login? After several requests to email the permission to setup the Deco (hours), I guessed that the email was never sent because I have a personalized email address (for 15 years) and the request was silently dumped.\\n\\nTried a burner Gmail login and it worked so I could start the setup. The early warning about things to come was the app's toy interface. Mysterious icons, no technical information. Tried to find a real tech manual but the User Manual was just a repetition of the icon help buttons. So I muddled through the buttons and without any technical details, it said OK. Adding the second unit was very quick, repeating the the OK message. And it seemed to work...until the next day.\\n\\nAll devices reported no internet connection. I had a mandatory conference call and quickly swapped back to my old WiFi router. Finished the call and decided to give the Deco another try. Since it remembered the initial setup, I was up and running quickly. My TV (Panasonic plasma,15 years old) uses a network cable and the Deco has two unidentified LAN ports. I wrote to TP-Link support (since the manual is useless) and they said they are 'universal' LAN ports. Plug in your cable modem in any port and anything else in the extra port. I did, but it never worked. I tried scanning the network to find the printer's connection.\\n\\nWhoa! It found the printer but NOTHING else. I checked my PC and it now had a new subnet 192.168.68.xx. I changed the network scanner to search this new subnet and *ALL* of my devices (printers, latptops, phones) had been changed to the 192.168.68 network. This included printers that were setup as fixed IP addresses! I quickly turned off the Decos, replaced them with my Asus and one extender and things managed to return to normal.\\n\\nTech support takes a couple of days for each question and always starts with a reboot of everything and a long list of have-you-tried rather than an explanation of what the router did. I don't have weeks of time to experiment so back it goes.\\n\\nI will say that the seamless transition between units was OK and coverage was very good in my1800 sq.ft house. But what could have been a good product has been ruined by a childish interface, some mysterious code to make things better behind the scene and no real tech manual to help.\",\n",

Construction technique makes it a challenge for wireless, but the Deco performs well. I bought this one to add to the 3 units we already have. I'm not even sure I need it, but it went on sale and I added one to a room that's furthest away from any unit.\\n\\nSet up couldn't be much simpler, and it's great to have another layer of protection from viruses and malware. The iOS management app is good and gives you a level of visibility and control that is better than other routers I've worked with. You can even do a remote reboot of the system as I recently did when the FBI advised to do so.\\n\\nOne more great thing about these -- every unit includes two Ethernet jacks. Not all of the mesh systems include an Ethernet jack on every unit.\",\n",

       " \"It's important to know that this mesh routers are not an AP. It will connect to your AP router (I have a Frontier router with coax cable attached in the back - see photo) using supplied cat5e cable thus creating a new network. The DecoM5 does not have that coax connector. So, in this case all peripherals connected to my AP will not be accessible by computers connected in the DecoM5 and vise versa. I have dead spots in my home I needed to fill and this was a the best solution without breaking the bank. It is dual band with 2.4 & 5Ghz and will automatically use the best possible band available at time of connection. Set up is easy using the app. Connecting additional units had some hiccups but corrected itself. I just made sure that the additional unit was close by during that set up before moving it to another room which is about 40 feet away with a kitchen wall separating it. The units does feel warm at the top but does not get overly heated. I love the parental controls (for my 11 yr old) and security features that come with as well. The 2 cat5 ports in the back of each unit is a must for me. Others don't have it. If you are able to connect the units with a cat5e, then you're guaranteed a much faster throughput.\",\n",

After some fiddling with the Deco M5 to update the firmware on both units, she is now getting 80 Mbps in the living room and the connection is very stable. Awesome!\\n\\nOne tip while setting up: the app is super simple to follow, but you will be creating a new WiFi network, so you will need to update all devices to use the new network. If you need to update your firmware on the Deco (which is likely), your phone will probably revert to picking up the old network while the devices reboot. I didn't realize this initially, and thought I was getting slow speeds - but that was because I was back on the Verizon modem/router network. Once I re-selected the new network in Settings - super fast speeds were back! Good luck!\",\n",

My WiFi 6 laptop regularly connects to the slave router with 1.2 GB speeds. Speeds for legacy ac wifi devices average 150MB, limited more by my internet provider than the router. A word of advice -- take some time to play around with placement of the master and slave in you house. Personally, I found it better to have these devices on the middle floor of my 3 floor home and to have them placed as centrally as possible (regardless of number of walls/obstructions) and overlap their coverage zones in order to maximize connection speeds, coverage, and seemless roaming.',\n",

The Guest Network is quick to setup and can be isolated from the rest of the network just by checking a box. You can even create VLAN's!\\nThe system options to customize your wifi network are almost sufficient and really easy to do. Only thing I am missing (I might have overlooked it) is the option to enter a custom DNS. Also, I am not sure how to backup my custom configuration.\\nI did not buy this system of Wifi 6 but found out that my S10 (and only that one) is AX capable. The speed increase with Wifi 6 compared to Wifi 5 on my S10 is slightly higher (410 Mbps vs 490 Mbps).\\nIn summary, so far I am happy with my purchase and look forward putting my Aruba and Unifi system into the storage.\\nUPDATE: After using this product for a while I have observed the following:\\n- Wired or wireless backhaul have similar speeds. Mine are about 25 yards apart within line of sight.\\n- I have a 400 Mbps down speed but Azores mesh caps out any connection at 200 MBps, even when hardwired to the master module. Also, AX wifi download varies between 13 MBps and 367 Mpbs (5 feet away from the wifi module).\\n- Frequent disconnects on my AX capable phone. Also, the Wifi6 range seems to be limited, after 8-10 feet it falls back to Wifi5. The disconnects are annoying and eat my LTE data.\\n- The management software is nice but limited and still does not have any halfway advanced features, such as custom DNS settings.\\nI am somewhat satisfied with this product but if the random disconnects stay or get more frequent I might be forced to return it. With few improvements (disconnects, management software) this could be a fantastic product.\\n\\nUPDATE 2: Problem with the satellite unit. Disconnects are more frequent and a there is a burned smell coming out of the satellite. Contacted the company and the company immediately next day. They are very helpful.

       " 'I\\'m conflicted when it comes to the D-Link AC2600 Smart MU-MIMO Dual Band Mesh Router (DIR-2640-US Black). The thing is that I know that most people don\\'t know what a router is, or what it does. They will never go into the settings of the router, beyond just changing the admin password and their wireless SSID and WPA2 settings. I\\'ll give a bit more in-depth review anyway.\\n\\nThe DIR-2640 comes in a slick retail box. Inside, you get the router, a larger than expected power brick, and a flat Ethernet cord. The router is handsome, with 4 flip-up, non-replaceable antennas. Interestingly, the unit sports purple LEDs for the indicator lights. Physical setup consists of plugging in the DC adapter (with it\\'s shockingly short power cord), and connecting an Ethernet cable from the router\\'s WAN port to your cable/DSL modem or fiber transceiver.\\n\\n\"Soft\" setup, for me, consisted of connecting to the router\\'s admin page. The router defaults to being a DHCP server, and to parking itself on 192.168.0.1. After changing the admin password of the device, I changed the base subnet and DHCP pool range. Next, I changes the SSID and WPA2 password. By default, the DIR-2640 does not allow you to set the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz SSIDs independently. Instead, the \"Smart Connect\" feature causes them to both have whatever SSID you specify. I then enabled and set up the \"Guest Zone\", which is basically a VLAN\\'d guest network. This is a great feature for all of your IoT devices, since it\\'s best to not have them on your main LAN. The last things I did were to turn off WPS (it\\'s insecure), and turn off IPv6 DHCP.\\n\\nWhile the management interface is clean and easy to use, it\\'s super obvious that the router is just REALLY BASIC in terms of its feature set. It\\'s almost like D-Link decided it was best to not offer anything more than the most basic features for fear of confusing the average home user. There\\'s port forwarding (only 24 entries), but no port triggering. There\\'s QoS, but it must be by host (no protocol or port option), and there are only 5 \"buckets\" for prioritizing devices - so weird. There\\'s some rudimentary access control, but nothing that\\'s really robust enough to be considered parental control. There\\'s a VPN, but you can\\'t automatically generate profiles for non-iOS devices. The frustrating thing is that you know that the SoC is more than capable of doing all of the \"big\" router things... D-Link just doesn\\'t let it.\\n\\nAs far as the router\\'s performance goes, it is fine. I have the DIR-2640 on a 450 Mbit/s dl/ 25 MBit/s ul connection, with about 30 connected devices. I fired up Chariot and sustained bandwidth didn\\'t suffer, even with the NAT on the device handling 3000 open connections. Not bad for a home router. There\\'s no CPU utilization indicator, so it\\'s hard to say how it would scale to a 1 Gbit/s connection, but I\\'d assume it would be ok. The wireless performance is extremely good, with a Pixel 3 XL and an iPhone 11 Pro Max both managing to transfer at 300-350 Mbit/s from 30 feet (through two walls). The 2.4Ghz range is particularly good, too. This router supports mesh networking, but I didn\\'t have a satellite AP to try with it.\\n\\nThe bottom line is this: if you want a set-and-forget home router with good wireless performance, the DIR-2640 is definitely worth a look. However, if you are the type of person that will need to actually get in and need to do anything moderately advanced (there\\'s no VLAN support, for example), then this is not for you.

       " \"For some reason this model is not very popular and perhaps that's why its price is lower than that of many of its competitors. Nevertheless I find this router amazing for its price (<$120). It gives me good signal (a little higher than my previous wifi 6 router) and what's very important for me: external USB 3.0 HDD support. Now my whole family can save their files to the external HDD attached to this router with high speeds (~40-50 MBytes/s from another floor of the house) and watch movies from it, etc. Highly recommended. Thank you to the seller for providing this model.\",\n",
       " \"Once you get it running, it's absolutely perfect and stellar for the price. If you're looking for something that doesn't double as a wireless access point (e.g. wifi router), then you are probably already totally capable of setting this up. I'd say it's much easier than shutting off wifi on a typical wifi router.\\n\\nAnyways, to agree with the (rightfully) top review, there's a couple little gotchas.\\n\\nDO NOT JUST TRY TO PLUG THIS IN AND HOPE IT WORKS!\\n\\nIt won't. Save yourself the frustration and just follow the easy setup guide.\\n\\n- Plug your PC into ETH0 and configure your PC's static IP address to 192.168.1.x (I used 192.168.1.10 just something other than 0 or 1). To do so, follow these steps: https://pureinfotech.com/set-static-ip-address-windows-10/\\n\\nOnce you've done that, go to 192.168.1.1 in your browser, and it'll ask if you want to do the basic setup wizard. For the 99% case, this is what I recommend.\\n\\nFor reference, I'm running my router into a 16 port switch, that goes to another hub in the main house, two WAPs over PoE, and 12 CAT6 wall jacks. If your setup is more complex than that, stop reading this and go be a professional :)\\n\\nLast gotcha for Cable users. TURN OFF YOUR MODEM! Then plug that into ETH0. Then turn on your modem and note that you will NOT have internet yet. Now, WAIT... I'm not sure why exactly, but as the top review noted, it just took a minute or three for things to magically work themselves out.\\n\\nEnjoy! (PS the screenshot is what Comcast gets you, the router barely even feels such low bandwidth.)\",\n",
       " \"I've been running this router after my previous consumer device failed. So far I've been very pleased! It isn't super-intuitive at first, but once you get the hang of the UI and a couple of basic console commands (yes, it has a CUI too) it is set up and super fast, especially for the price. I did not need QoS enabled so I was able to enable hardware acceleration of a couple of features to make it even faster.\\n\\nIf you get one of these and it is new to you, do yourself a favor and wander over to YouTube and watch a few tutorials.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Inexpensive\\n- Fast enough for most home and small office users\\n- POE options, including passthru (see specs for specifics)\\n- TONS of features, great as a home/small business internet firewall\\n- Can use dual/redundant WANs\\n- New features are added with firmware updates\\n\\nCons:\\n- More challenging than a typical consumer router to configure, but this also means it is more powerful\\n- Doesn't work with Unifi Network Cloud software - this is a major con, the Unifi USG does work with this software but has other trade-offs. Do your research.\",\n",
       " \"My last router wasn't capable of routing packets fast enough for my new gig Internet connection, so I upgraded to the ER-X after a lot of research. I'm a network engineer, so naturally, I wanted a router with features you wouldn't normally find in a consumer router, like creating multiple network segments (SVIs & VLANs), and zone based firewalling. (Although this isn't necessarily a consumer router, it's definitely at that price level). Since I run enterprise class APs in my house, I didn't need an all-in-one router. So far I've been very impressed with the feature set and performance of the ER-X!\\n\\nUbiquiti has done a great job of documenting GUI and CLI configuration for the ER series online. I like that they have examples of CLI configuration that you can copy/paste right into your ER. Makes for quick setup when you don't know offhand how to setup something like zone-based firewalling.\\n\\nNote: out of the box, hardware offload is disabled, so you'll find that the ER-X maxes out around ~300Mbps due to the CPU maxing out. I wasn't aware of this limitation and stumbled across the fix - enabling hwnat offload. Once you enable offload, you'll get around 900Mbps throughput. Similarly, IPSEC offload is available.\",\n",
       " 'I added an EdgeRouter X to my Netgear CM600 modem and R6230 router (now in AP mode) to eliminate getting port-scanned, pinged etc and worse. And it is working. My logs are free of port-scans now and I don\\'t wake up to find all my devices had shutdown or rebooted in the middle of the night. Wherever the hell that was coming from.\\n\\nYes, it was troublesome to set up. The instructions of Kyle Cook helped a lot (thanks Kyle !!! ). The only deviation from Kyle\\'s instructions that I found necessary is after the initial edgerouter setup (single PC into eth0), I booted the devices (modem, router, AP) WAITING for each to fully boot before the next device. Modem fully booted, plug in the router. Wait for internet connection then turn on the AP. Test the wifi. But this might just be a Netgear thing. I turned the 6230 into an AP before adding the edgerouter.\\n\\nBefore reading Kyle\\'s review, I tried the WAN+2LAN wizard which didn\\'t work for me. What was needed is the \"Single LAN\" option in the WAN+2LAN2 wizard. I haven\\'t tried to add any firewall rules to the two rules setup from the wizard because I don\\'t think I need to add any.\\n\\nWAN_IN\\nWAN_LOCAL\\n\\nThey are set to allow \"established/related\" connections and drop any \"invalid state.\" All my LAN connections worked without any further router or firewall configuration/intervention. That is so much better than any soft firewall. I tried the CLI command terminal (upper right corner) and installed a router update through that.\\n\\nSo it was tricky because of my user ineptitude but the payoff has been huge.',\n",
       " 'I bought this device to replace an aging RV180 that didn\\'t seem capable of routing a 100Mbps WAN connection. I have a much more complex LAN than the average home user will have. That being said this device really isn\\'t too hard to setup at all, and there is more advanced configuration available for users that need it. Most of the setup can be done using the GUI but some of the advanced features will require using CLI.\\n\\nAnyways before this device I was only capable of getting about 62Mbps down. After getting the ER-X configured and setup I am not able to pull down 117Mbps, and over my Ubiquiti nanobridge connection I am maxing them out basically with 92-99Mbps down. So far i\\'m very satisfied with this little \"cheap\" router. This router is cheaper almost all home routers and can do much more. If you need WiFi, I would suggest going with some Ubiquiti Unifi AP\\'s.',\n",

These are not as simple to configure as most home \"routers\". A lot of the options in the web GUI simply don\\'t work, or don\\'t expose enough settings to work. To do anything beyond the basics you need to get comfortable with the CLI interface, which isn\\'t too bad but will seem daunting if you don\\'t have a networking background.

       " \"I'm using the ER-X at home, because I got tired of glitchy consumer routers with serious unpatched vulnerabilities. It works well once I got it set up, but (as many other reviewers have noted) that process is not for the faint of heart.\\nBasic setup with the WAN+2LAN2 wizard was a snap, but advanced features that are fairly simple on consumer routers usually require a Google deep dive to figure out, because Ubiquiti's documentation is not much help. An added complication is that some features can only be configured in the CLI, but making changes in the web GUI after doing so can overwrite the CLI changes.\\nWith all that said -- I have gotten the ER-X to do most everything I wanted, and so far the performance, stability, and uptime have been excellent. Getting to that point was more work than I expected, but I'm happy with the result. My network is more stable now and performance is solid.\\nTIP: I bought a a Unifi-AP-LR access point to use with the ER-X. The POE injector that came with the AP easily powers both devices. The trick is that you have to enable POE passthru on port eth4 in the router to power the AP.\",\n",

A guy in the review section said he watched a video on some guy going in depth with this specific Splitter, yada yada yada, now what caught my attention was that he mentioned he'd been playing around connecting the main ethernet cord coming from the router into different ports on the TENDA splitter to try and get better results. The guy in the reviews mentioned that the best place to connect the main ethernet to was to the 1st connection, in the manual it mentions specifically that it should go into the 5th one. I just want to let people know that the manual is right, and I did speed tests 3 for each with main cable swapped into 1st and 5th place for a total of 6 tests. Your best bet is to put the main ethernet coming from your router into the 5th one like the manual mentions(pictures check out).

There’s nothing to the thing and I can move wires around and test speeds. I’m tech savvy there’s nothing they can tell me or teach me over the phone. Hopefully there’s another issue causing the speeds to suffer but right now I feel it’s the unit and I feel it’s incapable of getting to the speeds my home router can push through the Ethernet cord.
