"An affordable beast ! Pros: 1. Incredible performance, will average minimum of 60FPS on any game (except cyberpunk) at maximum settings at 1080P, even in games with ray tracing. 2. Display is very good, high refresh rate makes everything better 3. Fans are good at keeping temps down 4. Trackpad and keyboard are good Cons: 1. When the display shows something totally black, like in a loading screen, you can see the backlight bleed and prominently observe glowing patches on the screen. 2. Fans, ... READ MORE",5

Go for it guys this is beast machine. Thank you acer for this product and flipkart for the best deal. Render process is super and Best part is Ray tracing you can feel the game.,5
"This laptop is a beast, and a steal for your money. The combo of rtx 3060 with i710870H is just too powerful. Can run any game at high settings. Benchmarks: - valorant: I was getting 130+ fps in high settings easily -warzone: I was getting 80-100 fps easily in high settings -gta online: I was getting 100-110 fps in high and very settings  In all the games played for 4.5 hours straight, the cpu temp. never went above 75 degree C and the gpu temp. never crossed the 67 mark. Clearly it can ... READ MORE",5
The Laptop is a masterpiece with stunnig design and premium looks. The packing is awesome with a case to store it. The keyboard is customizable to different RGB colors via the Predator sense application.  The fan is quite loud when turbo mode is turned on. The screen brightness levels are extreme. You can easily have a great experience even while using it outdoors.,4
"Good laptop but customer care folks are real disappointment, as no information was given regarding Accidental Damage Protection which comes complementary with warranty extension if purchased within 7 day of invoice date and if missed cannot be covered. On the 7th day, I reached out to them but they didn't want to help, they said base warranty registration has not been done (for which no intimation was received neither any software directed for the same post first boot) and now it will take ...

Performance : Only one word INCREDIBLE will give easily 60+FPS at ultra in most of the games. 5 HDD and ... READ MORE,5
"Best laptop with great discount and offers . Flawless processor , awesome display and stylish body , which looks premium. Graphic card RTX 3060 is great for seamless gaming and graphic experience.I was searching a decent gaming laptop and choose this over MSI due to being loyal to Acer and better service network than MSI . I upgraded my I3 3rd gen to this laptop . RGB keyboard is cool but fans are bit loud and noisy however effective to keep cool . Not a bad deal , indeed .",5
"This is my first review ever. Value for money product. Good display except for the light screenbleeding issue but the colour accuracy makes up for it . Rendering in Adobe premier pro is quick without much of a framedrops, 90fps average while playing Forza Horizon 4 in ultra settings. So Gpu is great, thanks to RTX 3060. I7 10870h gives a decent Cpu performance. There is no overheating as such. Overall a decent package for content creators and game lovers.",5
"I got it at 107k around a month ago. I have played multiple games during this time, all of them in high/extreme settings and have not faced any issues. The display is also great. The weight of the laptop is not much and is very easy to carry. The speaker sound is not high enough. The turbo mode is enough to cool down your pc when its temperature is high(very rare temp rise).",5
Decent battery backup of 6hrs Display quality is good Design is good,4
Everything is Good but speakers are not that loud.,4
"Writing this review after a month usage got it for 46K Performance is good but sometimes the process lags. display is good, speakers are in the bottom which are not upto the mark. very good design. No heating issue. Battery backup 4-6hrs depends on your usage",4
"I'm very disappointed with the brand as the keyboard issue pertains in their two laptops I purchased with the same configuration. Their ""@"" key does not work. I've come to believe that probably this is an issue with their i5 laptops. Even if I get a replacement I wonder how far I can rely on this brand as twice I've faced this issue and the laptop was heating up a lot.

"Product is good but the fan is running continuously, its little annoying if you live in a quiet peaceful area. Second thing I have mention is the build quality of the product. Its made of plastic, not the best one but little low in quality. Otherwise it is a good product, good display, good performance, good battery life, soun of the speakers are also loud. I'm satisfied with this product.",4
"It's just amazing!

"Very nice laptop in this price to do basic stuff browsing and MS office use. You get HP's name and quality. Laptop takes time at boot but that's fine you can start laptop little bit early before your work. I bought HDD version cause it gives more storage than SSD. After the start laptop runs smoothly.

Good laptop with needful specifications.  Hard disk - 1 TB HDD Ram - 8 gb Finger print sensor - yes   Overall stylish and worth on this price range. Thanks flipkart,5
"its a decent laptop for light purpose like surfing, watching, office etc. You can code as well. ram is 4*2 configuration. Little disappointment over build quality, its made of low strength plastic coated with metallic silver. Overall look is decent. Small less graphic oriented games can be played over this. Display is not much bright as you can check in specs as well.",3
"The laptop is nice. Screen panel is really sleek and great. Fingerprint sensor takes around few seconds. You will have to install chrome in that. Other than C no other disk drives are available (or I don't know how to add the other drives). The only down point which really bothers me after 3 weeks of usage, is that the colour of keypad and colour of laptop is 99% same. Its very hard to type without good lighting.

Well a good product at the price range below 50K It does have a ssd slot and yes due to single channel 8gb ram and hdd it will lag a bit...but once you uninstall msi app player it will work smoothly... To get the optimal performance of the processor and gpu you should add another 4gb or 8gb ram stick...and I can assure it will work smooth as hell....ovell a good laptop... Due to 8gb ram it will lag in games a bit ...but that's not the problem of device.....you can add another stick of ram,5
A good computer in this range. Its smooth good for gamers. It has good capacity of hdd and ram alongwith graphic card,5
"My first MSI laptop and previously i was using Dell inspirion,since 8 years.the first impression is MSI is doing a great job providing a decent laptop at lowest reasonable price in comparision to other companies.About pros and cons I Will update after 2 months of use.",5

"The Laptop is best for its price range..The processor is good for normal purposes and even for some games. Those who would like to know about the graphics card model, The graphics card is : Intel UHD Graphics 32EU ( Jasper Lake ) which is better than UHD 620 but still, not best for high end gaming.

It's the best value for money laptop at this price point. Lenovo nailed it. No compromises done.,5
Well just go for it if you are not into hardcore gaming as it does not have a dedicated graphics card. Rest assured you will not be disappointed.,5

"Here is my honest review after couple of weeks.  PROS: 1) Specs. i7 10750h with RTX2060 is a deal breaker. 2) The GPU(RTX2060) is the latest one, i.e 115Watts. Which means it has better performance than previous RTX 2060 3) Per Key RGB keyboard by Steel Series is just fabulous. 4) MSI dragon centre application. This app has many features including overclock for GPU, set maximum charge capacity of the battery so the battery doesn't wear out if you use the laptop always plugged in. 5) The mothe...

Absolutely great performance laptop at this price range.  Awesome display and has great audio quality even tho the speakers aren't that loud.  Are we talking about laptop web cams? NVM.  Here comes the main topic/issue.. Device thermals!!  Yeah you heard right... This beast can reach around 80-85¬∞C with max continuous performance.  You can control it with power management to CPU by keeping its performance limited to 99% :P . You can see around 65-75¬∞C with cooler boost either on/off.  The bes... READ MORE,5
Best laptop for high end gaming and content creators It is ultra smooth but heating is an issue well fans do their job well make it comfort in room temperature  Talking about display it give about 65% ntsc Speaker quality too good But battery backup is. a little low but for this performance it is not a big thing  Overall it is a good choice For keralaits authorized service only available in cochin well that's a con,5
"Fantabulous purchase. Everything's fine. RetailNet is trustworthy. AFTER 2 DAYS OF USE, here are my reviews--  Firstly, I must say that RetailNet sold me a genuine product, no fake component has been found so far. It came with all the promised softwares with 144 Hz display. So, I am fully satisfied with the buying perspective.

"First of all, MSI has been great with after sale service. I have asked many questions on their Instagram DM and they habe responded very quickly with the solutions. Second, the laptop feels like you have paid one and a quarter lakh for it. I am able to run Forza Horizon 4 at 144fps on Balanced mode. So the Extreme performance is rarely used for me. By this you can understand how much powerful it is. And the fan is very quiet in Balanced mode which is a plus point. Only issue is that the power... READ MORE",5

The display is great when you tweak with the contrast and colors in intel command center. 4. The battery life is fine when you use it to work or surf the internet (3-4 hrs). 5.

"Tested this beaut on various AAA titles(RDR2, HZD, Apex etc.) on High settings(not ultra) giving 70+ fps throughout without thermal throttling. Gaming mode is effective and keeps thermal down, although fan sound is a bit noticeable(With headset its okay).

At the current scenario where a proper Graphics card windows laptop is costing around 1.2 lakh at a min. This MacBook Air M1 is the best deal and I got it around 82k so I received the best deal. So we can now say Apple Laptop is cheaper in price than Windows.,5

The product is awesome. Don't believe in the myth that due to the absence of SSD the system will be very much slower. Only it takes time in the booting for the first time. Once it's setup then no problem at all. Don't waste extra 5000K for SSD if you are not a gamer.,5

I would say the best gaming laptop in this range with most value of money.,5

"The processor on this laptop - i5 10th gen 10500h is a hexa core variant (6 cores and 12 threads) and not the quad core variant (4 cores and 8 threads) which you would find on almost all the other i5 processor laptops in the similar price range. Also, GTX 1660 Ti is still a good buy. Not as good as RTX 2060 but way better than GTX 1650.  Overall, It's the best mid-range gaming laptop currently available on flipkart.",5

I have played GPU intensive games like Battlefield 5, Battlefield 1, Call of Duty Warzone etc. and didn't face any issue. The provided10th generation Intel i5 processor is of Hexa-cores. In games like Valorant, I am receiving 200-250 FPS in Medium Settings and 100-120 in Max Settings. The NVIDIA 1660-ti is still a really good buy and way better than 1650.  Heat Dissipa...

very good laptop with this price range .none of the brand will give you 6 core CPU with 1660ti mobile in this price. The battery backup is ok not terrible. run every AAA title with 70+ fps. the only problem this laptop has is a thermal issue. it has intel 1Oth gen CPU so you can't undervolted it from XTU but you can do that from bios. changing thermal paste(Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut recommended) also reduces CPU temp quite significantly. overall just go for it this is the best you get from thi...

"I got the intel i5 10500h version....its really a new chip, i was skeptical about this laptop, whether to buy or not. The battery backup is not good 2.5 hours maximum, performance is just awesome, even the build and its a very thin laptop I have just bought the laptop ao far its good , just played batman arkham knight a bit, lot to test more...... so far i am satisfied for now",4
"A Quick Advice after using this laptop for 20-25 days, turn off the Turbo boost from the BIOS Settings it will fix the clock Speeed to 2.5GHZ I have tested Just cause 3 CSGO and All the Triple-A Games it doesn't affect FPS A lot like maybe 5 Less FPS but Your temps goes Down From 95C to 60 - 70 C I have tested this in many games including Rise of the Tomb Raider, Fortnite, Star Wars: Battlefront 2 . I am getting 70+FPS in all games at ULTRA SettingsThough it takes a little longer to load game... READ MORE",5
"When it's come to 75k price range of laptops, it's really an awesome laptop at this price range. it comes with 16Gb ram, Nvidia 1660ti graphic, 512gb SSD and 144hz screen refresh rates makes it perfect gaming laptop. you can play mostly AAA title games at 60-70fps. it has some heating issue but you can solve it by a good cooling pad. advised to use keyboard mouse or gamepad for easy handling of AAA titles games.",5
"Overview: Good for the price. Pros: 1)good performance 2)Looks good 3)1660ti, wanted laptop with great graphics card so that i can play games for 5+ years without need to upgrade anything. Cons: 1)Worst battery, i didn't knew gaming laptops have bad battery but when i'm just browsing web or watching video in vlc still it gives only 1.5-2hrs. 2)Super battery mode is the worst the system gets lag even on doing normal tasks. 3)Display panel is not vivid and its only 45%ntsc and it has yellow ...

"Writing this review after using this laptop for almost a month. I was looking for a notebook with good performance. I use some rendering softwares and play games when I get time. The performance is really good. It's a beast for this price range. Thermals are really good. Expandable memory and even storage makes it even better. Laptop is around 1.8kg.

"It's A Greatest Product if You are on A budget! I got it for 57k ! Its good cause it has two GPU! I ran games like Gta 5 high and medium setting at 1080 p, Rocket League high settings 1440p, And very smooth experience just that laptop was too heated! Otherwise go for it!  I had bought it for coding and it works as champ!",5
"Battery life is good 3hr in normal use.light weight. Charging take 1 to 1hr 15 min to from 10 percent to full. Didn't find the product name in asus promo while registering for offer.It get little bit heat up while coding but become Normal after some time but overall good laptop.

Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è laptop I love it looking so punchy and slim it is my first pc and best pc,5
This is my first laptop with this brand and I'm happy,5
"Not 'THE BEST' for gaming. But if you are into development, this thing is best.  Some highlights of this laptop: - Very portable - Great display - WiFi 6 - SSD gives copying speeds of 500-800 MBPS - Responsive fingerprint scanner.",5
Very nice laptop and look also good,4
2 concerns 1.laptop durability 2. Battery  Remaniing good,5

Laptop is good at 8gb ram. After I've upgraded it to 16gb. It's working absolutely Great. I play PUBG on Smooth Extreme and it's totally smooth. I've tried HD and Extreme and it works fine but heats so i orefer smooth and Extreme. Upgrade Ram to 16gb and It'll be very fast. Btw it boots within 10seconds.,4
Everything is best. In this price range it is beast. Boot up speed upto 6 seconds . Display is awesome there is no screen bleeding problem. Resulation is also good. Build quality also good. Sound is enough for a single room not so bad it's good. Lastly I want to say that if you want to buy a budget gaming laptop then you should go for it.

First i thought it would reach me soon but it took a week My opinion about this laptop after one day of use Being a cs student this is perfect Laptop for me battery is good display is good but the sound is too low which can be neglected if u r not a Movie Holic person over all performance is good I will review again after using it for a month,1
Best laptop for this price range. Good for both programming and gaming. Also it arrived before the estimated date which is really goodüëçüëçüëçüëç  Edit(after 3 days of use) - Battery not that good. If i keep the laptop open from 100%battery...it gets upto 80% within 10 mins. Also I was using VS Code and the battery drained from 100% to 40% in battery saver mode within 1 hour. OVERALL THIS LAPTOP IS A BEAST FOR THIS RANGE.,4
"Very good performance laptops this range. Fast charging, display so good, overall quality wise good. Very fast booting and shutting down.",5
Its just fab best budget friendly gaming laptop it works so smooth,5
If you want a lowest budget gaming laptop then i would recommend this one as i got it in 45000 during big billion sale. If you are a gamer & want a lowest budget laptop with high specs then go for it but if your budget is good then you should go for other laptops. The working is perfect but when i purchased this one around a month my laptop adapter gone down & it took a week for a new one.,4
I was confused between asus and lenovo s145 laptop but chose go with this laptop because of build quality.  Lenovo s145 feels quite flimsy while asus is reinforced with metal plates under the keyboard and in side supports of screen.  4gb ram and ryzen 3250u is good for everyday uses and light office work like browsing with5-6 tab oepn in chrome and 2-3 office files and for heavy uses there option to increase ram capacity.

"Laptop looks awesome, processing speed is enough for your daily normal usage, battery backup is fine, build quality is acceptable don't expect to be as strong as business laptop, we need to handle with care, hinges are of good quality plastic, metal hinges could have been better, overall good as of now",4
4k videos lags a little bit. At this price segment we don't get much to complain about. Otherwise fast enough,5

"An honest review after using the laptop continuously for 3 days. In the beginning the laptop had some heating issues but they were solved by the 2nd day. The laptop is a 14 inch one which is easy to carry and handle. Also it is sleek which gives it a good look. The keypad is good but the mouse pad is a little flimsy. It could be better.

Also runs other development related applications like android studio and postman.  This beast handles everything smoothly!.

Laptop warranty had already started, before we logged in for the first time - perhaps an issue with seller - Petilante online.

It's fantastic best laptop below 60000,5
It is a fantastic laptop as it is so light and fast. I bought this machine on 2 ND May and needed software boots to start the machine. Since it was lockdown had to wait 18 days for an Asus engineer to visit and update. Once done it is a beast,5
"The best you can get, looks and performance both are to notch, supreme battery life, ultra fast speed. Display and sounds are fantastic, never seen any better till now. Till now it was, Apple was offering 7 at the price of 10, looks were alaways 10 out of 10 but now Apple is giving 15 at the price of 10.. Absolutely worth the price.",5
"Ultimate machine, best laptop I have ever used hands down. M1 macbook air is more powerful than any previous generation Mac or any Windows laptop. Awesome purchase. Thank you Flipkart",5
At the current scenario where a proper Graphics card windows laptop is costing around 1.2 lakh at a min. This MacBook Air M1 is the best deal and I got it around 82k so I received the best deal. So we can now say Apple Laptop is cheaper in price than Windows.,5

One of the best if you are looking out for a laptop for coding. I have tried running SOLR servers and working parrallel with tomcat servers running on eclipse and it works damn smooth.  Programmers don't hesitate until and unless you are looking out for ML and AI which eventually requires server with GPU only.

"Better laptops available in the same price range. Screen is only HD not Full HD, type C port does not take charging, and build quality is average. Core i5 is overrated and overpriced.",3
Well a good product at the price range below 50K It does have a ssd slot and yes due to single channel 8gb ram and hdd it will lag a bit...but once you uninstall msi app player it will work smoothly... To get the optimal performance of the processor and gpu you should add another 4gb or 8gb ram stick...and I can assure it will work smooth as hell....ovell a good laptop... Due to 8gb ram it will lag in games a bit ...but that's not the problem of device.....you can add another stick of ram,5
A good computer in this range. Its smooth good for gamers. It has good capacity of hdd and ram alongwith graphic card,5

bought for 49990. works pretty smoothly. i5-9300h is still beast processor even in 2021.doesnt weight a lot so you could carry it around. only weakness is battery but gaming laptop usually doesnt have much battery backup anyway.,5
Got this laptop for work and coding. It's nice. Performance is too good with ryzen 7. IPS Screen quality is good too. No leaks. But generally any 15.6 inch full hd 1080p resolution really make it hard to read font on screen. So I'm using it in 720p resolution.,5

Product does not provide 3 pin adapter with MacBook pro. Because of this metal body of macbook leaks current. You can feel this current when you touch your hands to laptop while typing.

The points that were holding me back from buying this laptop were :- * The Laptop's screen would be a bit dimmer & glossier. * Since, it's the i7 process is for Ultrabook's (U series), so will it give the full output as per it's capability. * Since, I am a CS Student I needed it for heavy usage.

I was confused between Lenovo ideapad 5 ryzen 7 4700u and msi modern 14 ryzen 5 4600u. Reasons I chose MSI:  1.

OPTION TO UPGRADE (BOTH RAM upto 32 GB & SSD upto 1TB) - Biggest reason of all. 4. Amazing display with almost 100% SRGB which is not found in any other laptop in d price range. N yes the dis...

Or its sensor touch is large in size so easily comfortable to run this laptop and it's fast charger 65 watt charges the laptop on about 1 hrs plz guys without hesitation go for it.

It is useful for net surfing, for online classes, watching movies etc. However it is not for gaming as it does not have a graphics card. Sound is not up to the mark. Camera quality is low. To sum it up, it's a good laptop for normal day to day use considering its budget price range.",4

Product review: I bought this laptop as I've used Lenovo laptops before but the quality of this laptop is just horrible. I'm really disappointed with its sound system . If someone is speaking in the same room and at same time you're watching video on this laptop you can not hear audio on laptop.

Bettery draining very fast. Can't even use consistently more then 3 hours but company claimed 4-5 hours. Performance is not up to mark. Can't even run on multi-tasking. Booting speed is also slow. Speakers also low volume.,4
I purchased this laptop in Oct 2020. It is having 4gb RAM. Which is not enough to WIN 10 latest version. Getting very version slow. At least 8 gb RAM is required. Now I need to upgrade with new extra RAM of same frequency to put in second slot. Alternatively I advice all to go for SSD hard disk. Due HDD hard disk it is getting slow. Better go for laptop with SSD hard disk and 8 gb RAM. This will give good speed.,2

The laptop has starting trouble. If the system is shut down with more than 50% charge remaining and not used for 5-6 hours the system does not start. You need to jump start the system using power cable which then takes more than 5 minutes to start. Once the system starts you can remove the power cable and the battery will still show the charge of more than 50%. Dell service has also been pathetic in this lockdown.

Heating Issues Battery Life Below Average Overall Fine Product,4
Laptop Heating up very fast. Low quality speakers and volume is really low. The Device is not upto the mark at this price range. Poor battery backup lasts max 2.5 hrs and 4 hours if battery saver is continuously ON. Feels little heavy compared with HP. I would suggest go for HP in this variant. Overall not worth the price.,2

"Base configuration works great for regular tasks including light photo and video editing. No struggle in day to day. The screen is really fantastic and the speakers are the best on a laptop one can find. 16 GB RAM starts to fill up quickly so if you are someone who needs to multitask a lot (editing video + bunch of tabs + Spotify) you might start running out of memory.

Great laptop if your use is lightweight. I have installed Linux and I'm using it for online classes ( 3-4 browser tabs and few pdf files ) so the RAM is enough for me and it is also upgradable. Well designed and lightweight. The fan is really silent. Display has decent viewing angles if you are looking down at the laptop but in the end it's a TN panel so can't expect much. Keyboard is a bit too easy to press so requires getting used to it.,5

No indications for caps lock,NUM lock etc Build quality is average. Hinges of monitor seems to be weak.",4
It's an IPS display... Great image quality manufacturing month is June 2021 Ssd very fast performance 4 gb ram is always at 80% so need to upgrade 1 month office 365 but need credit card to activate 1 month norton security So slim Light weight Bessels is very less...

Amazing loved it display was amazing Webcam was fine but keyboard performance amazing loved it,5
Happy with this product...must buy...ssd is very fast,5
Go this laptop for online class and media consumptions. So far the experience has been great.  Pros: 1080p Full HD screen. 256GB SSD Light Weight Slim and Professional looks. Good Battery. Genuine windows(no office though) No heating issue whatsoever. Light weight.  Cons Viewing angles are a bit off. 4GB RAM feels a bit less while running heavy apps. Speaks mediocre. You may need to remove many bloatwares preinstalled by acer.,5
"I was in confusion before order, when I received my lappy really loved it. Asus should we go this, yes of course in this process segment fingerprint unlock, compact design, backlit keyboard and superb display etc.. I really like my asus app for getting my laptop updated and healthy. Fast Charging is available. Battery i have not checked but fine decent packaging fast delivery thanks flipkart.",5
It's look really impressive and performance is very good but battery backup is not to much suitable for long time uses.At last it is a quality product..üëçüèº,5
After using 15 days I would say product is good to buy. 1. Sleek design. 2. Light weight. 3. Good battery backup. 4. Good performance according to configuration. 5. Sound and display is average. However my experience with flipkart is horrible but rating is given here to product - Asus Vivobook X413JA. I found it value for money and would suggest to go for it.,5
Good Laptop I have to do light office work daily and this one perfectly fits all my needs...this comes with only 4gb Ram but i have not faced any major lag issues so far.. Base Clock speed of 1.1 Ghz is quite less but the boost clock is good and in my case it hovers somewhere around 2.3 Ghz most of the time..  Battery gives me around 5 hrs of backup at 70% brightness which is not bad  Display disappointed me as the viewing angles are really poor...  I loved the sound system which is designed... READ MORE,5
"The laptop is thin and handy.. due to SSD booting speed is around 6 seconds. The ms office key is not included. Processor fan is close to display ,so you will feel warm . Backlit keyboard is advantage. I dont see in any other model under 38k.  Brought it for 33250 including bank offer and serve the purpose.  If you look for a stylish ,handy and daily use laptop..go for it . !!",4
"It is as I expected. Light, sleek, compact and decent quality. I really like its white colour glossy finish. I recieved this on 8.03.2021 in 36240 rupees. And I think in this price range no product exist today. And its specs are awesome.",5
I bought this laptop recently delivery was so fast and about this lap it was good I love this display and backlit keyboard some of disappointing matters there is no Ms office long time if u want you would buy 5k per year and battery was not superb it's ok and coming to booting it's was amazing Overall it's good and best lap for under 40k,5

"Reviewing after 4 months of use, It's a good buy.. works good for normal use. I only had 2 issues with it: 1. Display has less angles, you can view it from sides up or down you have to angle it directly straight at your face. I think it's a big disadvantage for a laptop. 2. if you want to use it for any audio software it's the worst, it doesn't support a lot of audio features, recording quality is worse than a phone. Even my 10 year old desktop windows 7 PC works way better with way less spec... READ MORE",4
pros: 1. cooler boost keeps laptop reasonably cool. 2. display is nice 3. boot time and loading time is also great thanks to ssd  cons: 1. 8gb ram is not enough 2. out of 512gb you get around 380gb ssd although fast is not enough. 3. performance according to price is great but gtx 1650 in other laptops is better than 1650ti maxq 4. speaker is clear but has no base and is poorly positioned  If you want to buy this laptop be ready to shed more money on storage and ram,4
Good graphics performance but still You'll not feel it's 9th Gen I5 processer. You'll feel lags in each task like opening windows explorer or editing videos. Video rendering speed is very good but while editing it hangs so many times. I have another Asus i5 processer without graphics but that's working like MAKHAN Keyboard is also little different so it takes time to get used to it. And yes you'll see it's heating more than normal when you're rendering videos or playing games,3

"Firstly I would like to start with battery performance, As many reviews on this laptop has given low battery performance. 1) Battery: I felt same initial 1 week that battery is less but there are settings in MSI center (It's an app in laptop) to change gaming mode which is not required all the time.

Now experiencing it, everything is good till today. writing this review after 1 month, has to see how long it will work better. thank you",4
Great product. Loved it. You get the same laptop in two variants. One with graphics 1650ti with maxq and the other with just maxq. Go for the one with ti coz it's new and advanced. This laptop does not have ms word( most gaming laptops do not have ms word) so it's better to think through.,4

Battery life 7-8 hrs Speaker are one of the better ones on laptop. Keyboard feedback is good, RGB are single zone customizable through Aura Sync Ram is dual channel mode ( 8 fixed + 8 upgradeable ) Temps are decent for thin machine, CPU can be undervolted through BIOS. Easy to recommend at this price range.",5
"Pretty great system. It's a generation old and doesn't contain an RTX graphics card so value for money has gone down. But the build is solid and it's a great productivity machine. GTX 1660 is great for non RT gaming, which I am satisfied with",5

Awesome product.. definitely you should buy it,5
Amazing product at this price range. Got it for 85k..,5

Best laptop in this price range .performance wise it is good but they should have given lifetime office because this variant doesn't come with graphics.mi should think about this like I am not buying this for playing games if it doesn't have graphics.so consider giving office free. Otherwise it is good .go for it if you dont play games.,5

"After 6 months, I decided to write up a review. Originally I was skeptical about the laptop as many people said it arrived in a defective condition.  I expected this to last around 5-6 months but it has already outpaced that assuming the reviews, but here's a review I decided to make.  For budget, this is pretty good for some work and light gaming. I occasionally use it for medium-level video editing and it holds well.

Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.,4

After 2 days usage am very happy to write this. It has amazing performance. Booting speed is just 5 seconds. Cute look. Handy size. Quick charging around one hour and the battery back up 5 hour. Windows and office is included so I could use just after sign in Windows. Camera is just ok for video calling. I am totally satisfied with this guys.,5
Performance wise the product is nice. Super fast boot and finger print recognition. The battery life and sound both are okish. Screen viewing angle is poor. The laptop is light weighted and looks good. The 14 inch screen suits to all need. Would recommed it to those who are buying a budget laptop. Can't be compared in any sense with a macbook air.,4
Awesome Product !!!!!!!,5
The product is really good and I have been using it for the past 1 month now. Performance is good.. Value for money... Definitely can go for it..,5
I've been using this laptop from past 1 week and here are some pros and cons that I came across while using this laptop-  1. Display- Display is pretty decen according to the price as every laptop in this price range uses same kind of LCD display if you are going to use this laptop for photo or video editing where color accuracy is really important then you have to buy an exernal monitor or you have to go with higher end laptop which give 100% sRGB value.

Brought this laptop after fair bit of research. Arguably the best performance per money in the market. I am impressed with the build quality as well. Thermal management is improved from previous generation. Highly recommended.,5
It's a Great Laptop. Trust me.... You can play Maximum games in Ultra settings. No need to worry about.... Frame drop.... You'll get 60+FPS. And the Nitro feature is just mind blowing..... Just being able to control your fans and rgb lights is really awesome.  Just what you expect from a gaming laptop. Well.... If ur up for it. Then don't think twice.... Just buy it. Hope you all have a great time with it.  Happy Gaming... üòàüòà,5
Perfect package for the budget  If you are using for gaming and office use this is the best option you can get.  60hz panel is good since the fps won't get 100+ in 1650 so 144hz is more or less a marketing gimmick.  Ryzen 5 variant is more powerful than i5 11th gen.  For initial use 8 GB ram is enough even if you are planning to play games like doom eternal it can give you decent 60 fps at combination of high and ultra settings.

"Nice Keyboard. It is very compact. Nice for heavy-duty daily work. The size has become smaller compared to previous models. Though I do not have much complain about the current dimensions, the previous dimension of a 13-inch laptop was better.  Cooling Fan noise irritates sometimes. Without much load, the fans turn on and you cannot turn them off. If you really do not need the quad-core core version simply go with dual-core one. That should be enough for most of the daily work.",5

"Usage:- Video Edits,Media Consumption,Light to heavy Office suite and work related usage  Review:- Goes like hell. Have a 10th gen i5 Lenovo provided by my office and this thing beats in terms of startup, CPU and GPU utilisation. Barely manages to heat up and most importantly, it's lighter and smaller.

Review after 1 month of usage. The Laptop is good for the price and the performance is good according to the Specs. The MRP is 59k and I got it at 55.6k during the demand filled Lockdown days. Ryzen 7 at this price is a very good deal and the performance is very good considering the price. The Boot speed is very good and the Fingerprint scanner to login is very fast as well. my other i5 Dell Laptop (6.5 years old) used to struggle with some video uploads (for Youtube) which has now become eas...

Don't doubt on its processor it is too fast. It's to sleek and lightweight. As many people where saying it's display is not good but according to me it's normal and it's support 4k at 60fps on youtube. The display used in this laptop is TN display which have not good viewing angles but it have a refresh rate. Battery performance is greater than my expectation I can easily attend 4 zoom classes after that too 39 percent battery remains which is awesome and it's speaker are louder and clear.,4

Got my first Macbook. I am really excited to explore this beautiful machine. Initial impressions-: - Build quality top notch full aluminum body. - excellent look. - Battery backup is not as claimed by company. In real world usage it is giving 6/8 hr back up.Here I am little bit disappointed.  I will put my full usage experience after 1 month.,4
"Nice Keyboard. It is very compact. Nice for heavy-duty daily work. The size has become smaller compared to previous models. Though I do not have much complain about the current dimensions, the previous dimension of a 13-inch laptop was better.  Cooling Fan noise irritates sometimes. Without much load, the fans turn on and you cannot turn them off. If you really do not need the quad-core core version simply go with dual-core one. That should be enough for most of the daily work.",5
Have received 2 days ago..Beautiful design..Working smoothly..A little bit of effort and time needed if you are switching from Windows but the experience have been pretty smooth so far. Need to invest in a few accessories like an USB hub or original software.,5

It a amazing product but with one flaw which make it amazing and not absolutely amazing that is it's thermals. But not really a bumer with flew tweaks you can adjust it. Windows on bootcamp also works better than other windows laptop. Don't buy this if you are going to work in hot temperatures it requires a cool temperature.,4

Consider purchasing this laptop for college work, normal gaming, coding work. Don't buy for gaming or color accuracy related work.",4
Ryzen 7 is much more faster and its response time of finger print is fast enough... I got this laptop in near about 58k . Battery backup is good for office or business purposes.

Laptop looks good but there are few flaws. As it is mentioned as highlighter that its has dolby digital sound which is absolutely lie.

Weight is too much so cant handle easily. Keyboard is not that smooth and it has unnessary space on keyboards and unneccary numers on keyboard whch seems like taking extra space for no use.

"After couple of days of comparing different laptops, I choose to buy this product a week back . Here are my comments Pros 1. Screen size & Display 2. Performance is good 3. easy to setup Cons 1.

Camera quality is similar to feature phones , i.e very low 4. the edges of the panels are sharp",3
"After 4 month uses I am writing this, 1st you need to reinstall the OS . Just install a fresh copy of Windows 10 same edition with all driver. Then just update the OS.

The laptop is amazing it has a amazing screen brightness... The mouse pad is little sticky kinda... Better buy a mouse.. It is an amazing product... The delivery person was kind and calm... I suggest u to buy it... Gaming is amazing and can play pubg pc in low setting smoothly,5
The product is stylish no doubt in that but it gives very terrible experience with the performance. It doesn't feel like that you are using Intel's I5 - 10th generation processor. If you need good battery backup then please don't go with it rather consider buying Asus. I don't understand how can they tell such big lies by claiming 6 hours battery backup. It only gives you 2.5-3 hours approx. back-up in normal usage.  Audio quality is also below average but if you use Dolby all the time then ... READ MORE,3
I share my feedback after 6 months. The battery back up is very poor. Lenovo calms that it would last at least for 4-5 hour but it just drain out in an hour or bit ahead to an hour. The configuration is Intel core5 10th Gen 900gb. Also some of the sw like McAfee they don't support to reactivate within the license validity. I request lenovo team to enhance the battery capacity.,5
Good quality and the finishing in perfect but the drawback is sound quality and camera quality is low,5

The second was MS Office preloaded. The third was an upper cap of Rs 35K.  I just stretched it by an additional Rs 2K was because it is a 11th generation processor.  The SDD can be fragmented by 100GB as an extra drive for storage of data.  The aesthetics are also pretty decent. It is value for money gadge... READ MORE,5

Webcam quality is extremely poor. Build quality is poor. Keyboard is mediocre. If you have large hands like me than avoid this laptop. Always check product like laptop in person that you will be using on daily basis for personal and professional purposes before making purchase.  This laptop is not recommended for coding purposes. Keyboard is extremely fragile.  Laptop body is magnet for greasy smudges. Better opt for metal body laptop.,2

It runs very smoothly with a fast operation speed. One of the best option for people who work on regular basis and needs fast operations done. Did not used for gaming and other high end softwares but I feel it will not disappoint you.,5
GWell its a bit smaller than usual laptops as it is a vivobook... But i will recommend this for students splly for online classes. It is the the best under 50k In every feature except the battery but it is still ok. Display is crystal clear and all over looks premium,5

The secondary screen is very useful and you dont need extra monitor which destroys the mobility of a laptop otherwise. Its fast and sleek. To me the keypad size is perfect and i am finding it better than normal sized keyboard. Overall you get what u pay for.,5

The biggest use case for a laptop is probably as a portable workstation they can be carried to office or to college. This laptop has to be powerful enough to get work done fast. It should be a device with a healthy battery back up and at the same time not too bulky. And it helps immensely if it‚Äôs easy on the wallet. HP‚Äôs new laptop called HP 14s is a product that tries to condense all the above-mentioned requirements . I am very happy.,4

Got this for 97k. Really a great value for money machine. RTX with top end processor under 1 lakh is very rare. You know it's good when it can run Cyberpunk2077 at full HD with DLSS and RTX enabled. Turbo cooling is a plus. Good design with RGB keyboard. Loving it.,5
So this laptop is quite good at this range. Used it on multiple AAA titles like apex witcher warzone and most of them were running smoothly at over 100 fps . Battery is okay that is quite known for these laptop. Cooling is quite good as temperature is low at even long gaming sessions. Overall a good laptop with decent value for money.,5
"This laptop has checked all the boxes and then delivered more in terms of software support and tricks which make it an overall amazing choice by date in my case.

Product is very good....But sound power and quality is very worst...Battery backup upto 3 hours only......otherwise MSI Modern 14 is WORTHY,4
- Display is good for watching movies. Got anti-glayer display - Finger print unlock is fast and efficient - Speakers are just okay - Good battery backup - Got plastic body - Keypad light is good  Overall good one.,4
Pros  Sleek and powerful laptop for medium day to day and office work. Battery backup is very good which lasts up to 8 hrs. Laptop power on/off time is very fast mainly because of 512GB SSD. Keyboard is compact with backlit and speakers are more of average type.  Cons  RAM is 8GB and cannot be upgraded further. Camera quality could have been better. Price is bit on the higher side.,4
was considering S340 and couple of other options. Went for this . Overall good has all the necessary features you expect in a Laptop at this price.  Light weight and ideal for school /college students.,5
Sleek and stylish for personal use. Battery backup is good compared to other laptops with its 57 Wh battery.,5
Don't purchase thus. Laptop has boot issues. Takes to much time to respond. My worst purchase ever. Flippant has not even replaced it. Very much disappointed with the poor services.,1
+ light weight + display + performance  - battery life mention 11 hours but it will give 5 hours only - sound quality just ok - heating,3
It's slim enough but sturdy for its dimensions. Bootup is faster. However I am a bit disappointed with the battery performance; the same discharges quickly.,4
The laptop has been amazing. With low brightness the battery has lasted for close to 11hours and with normal brightness it usually last upto 7 hours. Been using it for a month now. No issues. Only issue that I have noticed is the audio playback which goes off suddenly if I pause or rewind the video I'm playing. Same issue disappears when I use my headphones. Camera quality isn't very good.  Overall a great device. 3.5/5,4

If you plan to be carrying it around very often then make sure you are up for some weight lifting. The power brick is also extremely large and he... READ MORE,5
"No complaints when it comes to performance, be it general productivity or gaming. The RX5600M performs very close to Rtx2060 mobile, which is quite good. I am not a fan of the keyboard, the red backlit really is not necessary. The keys are a little smaller than an average keyboard, well spaces out though. The trackpad is large enough.

As per my opinion after using one month this laptop. Display & Design quality is awesome no doubt.Very slim and easy to carry without hesitation. Harddrive 1 TB is enough is this price range but Ram should be a bit higher 4 GB Ram couldn't process perfectly with 1 TB HDD. It should be at least 6-8 GB. But I contacted Lenevo Service Center they advised me to upgrade it if I need more so I've upgraded to 8 GB. Now it's working fine. For only home and office purpose it's very good. Not for gami...

Does its works. Some features of Windows 10 to be turned off to use it optimally. As example one drive synchronisation to be turned off. Battery should be balanced instead of power saving etc. Set the system for best performance through sysdm.cpl. There are 14/15 ways to boost up your computer in Windows 10. Please Google for the same. This item is good enough for personal or official use. Only thing that I dislike is it's camera. Only .3 MP.,4

Don't buy this if you looking for a laptop for business or urgent works...it lags a bit from the power on stage to an extent and was smoothly working only after a few moments after its booted complete. Even you may find lags while opening application that was already installed or installed from external sources. This review was made from my own experience and still if you looks for some budget laptop for light uses and study this may be good choice for those.,3

Performance wise it's a beast. 120HZ refresh rate won't let your gaming experience down and that is what makes this laptop feel better than its competitors. Slim and plain design. Overall it's a good gaming laptop at this price range. Presence of SSD and webcam would make this a perfect machine.,5

Review after 4days The display is not as perfect as the Legion Y540but has 120hz refresh rate compared to Legion's 60hz. The performance of the laptop is impressive.

Will update after some time.,4
It would be better if it had a inbuilt webcam,4

In real world usage it is giving 6/8 hr back up.Here I am little bit disappointed.  I will put my full usage experience after 1 month.,4
"Nice Keyboard. It is very compact. Nice for heavy-duty daily work. The size has become smaller compared to previous models. Though I do not have much complain about the current dimensions, the previous dimension of a 13-inch laptop was better.  Cooling Fan noise irritates sometimes. Without much load, the fans turn on and you cannot turn them off. If you really do not need the quad-core core version simply go with dual-core one. That should be enough for most of the daily work.",5
Have received 2 days ago..Beautiful design..Working smoothly..A little bit of effort and time needed if you are switching from Windows but the experience have been pretty smooth so far. Need to invest in a few accessories like an USB hub or original software.,5

It a amazing product but with one flaw which make it amazing and not absolutely amazing that is it's thermals. But not really a bumer with flew tweaks you can adjust it. Windows on bootcamp also works better than other windows laptop. Don't buy this if you are going to work in hot temperatures it requires a cool temperature.,4

"Good Laptop....Quality of build is very nice and strong....Average battery backup....Little slow at startup but after that it runs smoothly...For official work , students and games it's good but if you want faster response please choose SSD",4
Basically guys the first thing u have to know is RAM is expandable u have an extra slot u also have an m.2 ssd slot but u have to remove the hard disk first and then insert believe me u laptop will boot slow as hell like 150 seconds thereby putting ssd is mandatory for decreasing boot time games on graphics are pretty good and camera quality is decent but enough and sound is also decent BUT FOR THIS PRICE GETTING 3GB GRAPHICS AND THIS CONFIG I REALLY CANT COMPLAIN DISPLAY AND PERFORMANCE IS P...

Laptop is good in its range But just one point it will not be able to improve It does not have open ram slots Other wise its great to have it.,4
First day review: Initial impression was good. Packaged carefully and body looks sturdy and hard. Build quality is good looks solid and no shaky components. No lag or slowness on normal use. Need to see how this will be on heavy load. Camera is with privacy shutter which is very much needed. Display and total size of laptop looks big not sure why I'm feeling that way but I liked it that way.  Warranty already started and 2 month over. Battery after full charge showing 4.45 minutes remain... READ MORE,3
Best product in less prize I buy this pdt in sell at 46000 only best processing but battery 100 % stay for only 2.30 hr,4
GOOD QULITY OF PRODUCT. I BOUGHT AT 435000. IN THIS RANGE YOU GET THIS LAPTOP IT JUST MIRACLE. DONT BUY HP BEACUSE IT IS CHAP. MY PREVIOUS LAPTOP IS FROM HP WHICH NEED TO REPAIR MORE THAN 5 TIME. HINGES+ DISPLAY+ FAN . SO IN THIS LAPTOP I FOUND PERFECT BODY NOT HEAVY NOT LIGHT. I RESERCH EACH AND EVERY LAPTOP BUT I FOUND THIS ONE IS BEST. SO IF YOU ARE THINKING TOO MUCH LIKE ME .JUST BUY THIS PRODUCT.,5
Best laptop specially for playing games like GTA5 and all and the obvious thing is that if we are purchasing the laptor in which these games can run smothly so just think about the normal work surfing downloading and other softwares obviously will work smothly for sure  Just 1 minus point while playing GTA5 it heats too much,5
First of all product is received in nice packing. Laptop is very heavy....I mentioned this as first point so you understand the seriousness. Even the charger battery is also heavy. It takes nearly 1.5mins to boot. Performance wise it's good. Considering its weight you cannot carry easily That's the major drawback. You always need to be careful. Tried games as well it's amazing experience. Overall considering high configuration it's very good.,3

The performance is really amazing ; photoshop , Lightroom like software run like a hot knife through butter.  CPU performance is awesome , base clock speed is 2.6GZ but it easily reach 4.6-5 GZ due to turbo boost.  Display is very good with bright colour. Keyboard has 3 scale white backlight.

It has strong plastic body and a great finish. Strong processor i7 with clock speed upto 5 ghz, which i believe is steal deal at this price. it will easily run video editing softwares like adobe premium pro 2020. 256 gb ssd is more than enough. even if you want to play some heavy games by installing it on ssd u can ...

Did observe some issue with displays. For people using windows 10, text could be either slightly small or big due to scaling issues.

It is very rare to get a market disruptor in the field of laptop(s). But in this case I have found a hidden treasure.

It has actual 470 GB of SSD. Very nice Hinge Quality. Touch works very smoothly. Pre installed MS office, Macfree. Keyboard is giving a nice experience of typing. Battery Backup is about 4-5 hours while continuously using. Overall it's great 2in one convertible laptop at this price. I prefer everyone to go with this.",4
"Better performance, nice touch screen rate, Finger print work fast to logon, great deal so recommend to buy this laptop.",5
"Excellent features, the 10th Gen Intel and 512 GB SSD, the near Bezel less design and the 360 degree folding into a neat tablet has got me captivated. The build quality is Solid and really makes you feel its built to last. The illuminated keyboard and key travel is perfect. All in all..an excellent buy.",5
4GB base ram is an absolute sin otherwise the product is pretty much flawless IMO. You will find your system suffocated in terms of RAM if you open up 3 applications at once. I remedied that by installing an 8GB memory stick into the laptop. Now it works perfectly.  -1 Star outright for having only 4GB ram,4
"Satisfy my(student) use. One star less fr 4gb ram, which is really disappointing(but it can be extended to 12gb) Otherwise laptop is good at this price. Light weight, flexible, I can carry it anywhere. Low graphics game can easily run. Average battery life. Audio is good fr laptop.",4

Seriously need to improve battery drains fast on continues use otherwise performance is too good . Try to improve battery otherwise it's good . Battery wise and performance wise lenovo ThinkPad is best for this price. Only think I bought this instead of lenovo ThinkPad is HP is branded,4
"I did some fair research before going for this one.  First: I was looking for a laptop with full version MS Office so that I can carry out WFH things with ease. Second: I wanted a high performance laptop with good RAM and space to run several applications at once. Third: I am a big time Gamer, so needed a Graphics Card. Fourth: Price should fit in my budget.  This laptop has all 4 of them. Couldn't be happier.  You can go for this with eyes closed if your requirements are same as mine.",5

I'd say everything else is above average if not really perfect. If value for money is what you are looking at, look no further. This is it, as of now.",5

Nice one,5
Best laptop to buy under 65k. For work and light gaming. Only con - display is ok.,5
My touchpad is not working in a brand new product,1
Webcam quality is extremely poor. Build quality is poor. Keyboard is mediocre. If you have large hands like me than avoid this laptop. Always check product like laptop in person that you will be using on daily basis for personal and professional purposes before making purchase.  This laptop is not recommended for coding purposes. Keyboard is extremely fragile.  Laptop body is magnet for greasy smudges. Better opt for metal body laptop.,2
The laptop is pretty descent for normal usage.Battery will disappoint you a liitle bit As i am a student so i usually have to attend 4 to 5 hours of online class but it goes around 4 and half hrs only...in normal usage.

Flipkart packing was not good. Laptop box was kept in a large flipkart box without any bubble wrap or support and it was moving around inside - could have caused damage to laptop but luckily it was not damaged. The laptop is good. Software as promised. Office student version is free lifetime. Mcafee antivirus is free for 1yr. Finger print sensor works well. Overall good laptop.,4
It runs very smoothly with a fast operation speed. One of the best option for people who work on regular basis and needs fast operations done. Did not used for gaming and other high end softwares but I feel it will not disappoint you.,5
GWell its a bit smaller than usual laptops as it is a vivobook... But i will recommend this for students splly for online classes. It is the the best under 50k In every feature except the battery but it is still ok. Display is crystal clear and all over looks premium,5
"It very good laptop for daily use , I am working from home and using this daily 9 to 10 hours and it's working fine, I have to charge one time only and battery backup is almost 9 to 10 hours according to my usage.

Well not as per expected many problems are at new I don't know what going to happen  I'm giving review after use of 2 months just used for school purpose I've not played any game Performance is tooo bad Sound was not much compared to my old HP laptop  I will suggest you all to increase your budget little more and go for Asus vivobook S14,3

Keyboard layout is not ideal, will be difficult to get used to it, but its fine.  Screen is good and bright. Build quality is really durable, if treated well this laptop should last you a very long time",5

"I ordered it and the laptop finally arrived 3 days ago. I have used it since then for online school and general stuff. Even though it has some bad reviews its not a bad laptop.

One of the underrated device with great performance and incredible design. 1TB ssd makes the system very smooth and it boots within 4-5 seconds.

Viewing angle is bad.,4

Does its works. Some features of Windows 10 to be turned off to use it optimally. As example one drive synchronisation to be turned off. Battery should be balanced instead of power saving etc. Set the system for best performance through sysdm.cpl. There are 14/15 ways to boost up your computer in Windows 10. Please Google for the same. This item is good enough for personal or official use. Only thing that I dislike is it's camera. Only .3 MP.,4

Touch is okay as per the tunning on movement of fingers & cursor.",4
"It's not as stylish and sturdy as the original Zenbook 13 series. Earlier felt more solid and this and the keyboard was better.  This feels like a low cost version of the fabulous Zenbook.

Excellent.. Quality of plastic and body is very nice. Does not get heated with heavy browsing and watching movies online. It has finger-print + power integrated button.

Good product. Blazing fast boot! Just 5 seconds from power on to fully loaded desktop. Display is amazing. One small con is the laptop build quality is not that good. I guess that is due to plastic and expected in this price range (because most of the cost goes for the Intel i5),5

Worst experience ever don't ever think of buying this product. the laptop which had received by me had a battery issue so I replaced it with new one. The other one also had same issue. I think flipkart never opts for a quality check. There are willing to sell anything without even inspecting it,1

"Excellent purchase. I am very happy with my purchase and it is worth the amount as I am not able to point out any faults in construction or performance of this laptop, after around 2 months of usage I have found out that unlike usual slim laptops which sometimes go as far to dim the performance of the laptops and even when it completes all required mandatory requirements of intel Evo yet for some unknown reason they have not spend the extra money to get the Evo badge.

Alternatively, you can control fan speeds manually thanks to the pre-installed Predator Sense app. The trackpad has a smooth surface and a red outline. It offers a decent siz... READ MORE",4
"Its an overall good product and for the money it sounds good at-least on the paper. But when you start scratching it under the surface, you will realise how Acer has cut corners on India spec models. Following things are have been swapped to lower grade items when compared to USA spec models: 1. Screen on it is from Che Mei instead of LG Philips, so it has poorer color reproduction(sRGB 69% coverage vs 82% on US spec model). 2.

"writing a review after massively using for 30 days. first, we talk about what good in it:- as you go through specifications you will find all features like i5 11th gen, 8 GB ram, 1TB HDD etc. but I am here to mention some physical overview and share some personal experience. 1. build quality is good, you will feel it, silver colour, slim body, Fp reader all made it a premium product. 2. display overview is phenomenal, full HD, IPS and antiglare display give you a wonderful viewing experience....

Excellent laptop. No doubt this is the best laptop under 55K segment. Everything is fine including picture quality and sound. Laptop is light weight so easy to carry. Build quality is also good. It's performance is highly appreciated and satisfactory. For heavy users a SSD can be recommended for additional enhancement in performance. Blindly go for this laptop if you intend for office work or study.,5
At start boot time was more but after that boot time is fast.battery backup is upto 5 hours with balanced mode.laptop design is fantastic.fan sound is little bit more.but finally it is more than ok for 53k and too in hp brand it's well and good,5
Happy with the product.. After using it for 3months.... I am giving the review lately coz I want to give a genuine review... Good for office work... Happy customer,4
Upgrade to SSD for snappier performance. Does 720p low gaming for most of the modern titles. Great design. Low thermal. Light weight. Finger print. Great sound. superb WiFi connectivity. My only con is brightness. Which could have been better. Rest assured I don't think anything to else comes close to thin and light in this budget.  No complaints others than brightness. Which i feel is adequate but not enough for me.,4
"It was my first day experience with 2hours usage I Got this one day before, looks good nicely packed came with user manual.tell now good going, I had given 4stars because - No warranty Card given - No insurance or Laptop bag will not cover under this amount - Antivirus for 1 month, window 365 for 1month trial  I will continue reviewing after using some days.",4
"I would have rate it 5 but battery runs for 5-6hrs when using a single window, it would run much smaller when multitasking. It was written upto 12 hrs battery usage time in the specifications but i will be satisfied by if it goes to 8hrs of run. As temperature effect and other external causes batter usage time is decreased but not to 5 hrs. I have to charge it minimum 2 tims for use of 10-12 hrs in a day, when using single window. I think during multitasking it will run for 2-3 hrs only. Mo... READ MORE",3
Really nice one and I say that best at this range (52000)... Only downfall is that it has HDD storage which make it a bit slower but it does not effect or bother..... Could be best if SSD would be there with HDD.  But SSD would be costly... Go for it,5
Need to add ssd and backlit keyboard rest all are good.,4
Nice smooth great display the best of the money they should have given more strorage,5
"A great laptop with 6hr screen on time battery, only downside is that it doesn't come with a laptop bag, you will only get laptop and that's it, anyways the laptop is fine :)",5

Don‚Äôt expect much from it. It serves the purpose for its price. Good for browsing and simple multitasking. Can also play casual games and watch 4k videos. Good for students and teachers and basic computing.  Not for IT professionals. Gets slow some times. Add 4gb more ram for smoothness,4
So far good,4

I have MSI PS42 as well.. working fine for last 2 years .. This models hinge gave away in 3 months... The service center guy said that its and common issue and due to unavailability of parts it will take 3 weeks to a month to fix this. Also this model heats up a lot. Shame on MSI.,1

An amazing laptop . There are only 1 problems 1. sound quality is good but max volume is low,5
PROS 1)Light Weight and handy 2)in budget 3)metallic body 4)sleek design 5)Display is top class 6)you can find many but cons are also somewhat to be noticed Cons 1)you cannot work in the dark as there is no backlight keyboard(solution-you can use USB led lights or lamp ) 2)camera quality is not good and also the camera is not inbuilt you have to connect it first 3)In future you cannot upgrade RAM I request mi to work on the above cons to make it perfect 4)SATA SSD,4

Device is good but the price(66k) I bought it is out of the world..,5
Bad Experience for Hardware,1
There is some noise near hinge when you close or open the lid .,4
If Keyboard light must have an option for white light. Type C thunderbolt port missing. At least minimum 2 usb 3.2. Webcam shutter.  If these things are provided then this laptop become a must have laptop for medium families.  But in this price range this a super performer. 90 /100.,4
Overall performance is good but gets heat up quickly. The cooling system is best but air outlet is infront of display so screen also gets heated. A error occurred while gaming like it took exit unexpectedly,4
"It's really a good system specially for the students. It's stylus pen works very smooth. Full HD display. But webcam isn't very good. Also not placed in a perfect location. It has actual 470 GB of SSD. Very nice Hinge Quality. Touch works very smoothly. Pre installed MS office, Macfree. Keyboard is giving a nice experience of typing. Battery Backup is about 4-5 hours while continuously using. Overall it's great 2in one convertible laptop at this price. I prefer everyone to go with this.",4

4GB base ram is an absolute sin otherwise the product is pretty much flawless IMO. You will find your system suffocated in terms of RAM if you open up 3 applications at once. I remedied that by installing an 8GB memory stick into the laptop. Now it works perfectly.  -1 Star outright for having only 4GB ram,4
"Satisfy my(student) use. One star less fr 4gb ram, which is really disappointing(but it can be extended to 12gb) Otherwise laptop is good at this price. Light weight, flexible, I can carry it anywhere. Low graphics game can easily run. Average battery life. Audio is good fr laptop.",4

Only Pro Design/Looks and weight (1kg)",1
Product with nice design slim and lightweight chassy strong and well built fine keyboard the lift mechanism helps in typing nice case provided asus softwares included ms office installed but not activated Serious heating issues low speaker sound the dongle provided is 2.0  Overall nice product,3
"awesome purchase. I would like to say some things about this laptop. 1. The screen is good enough if you are switching from an old laptop. It's definitely an upgrade. 2. some people are saying that the speakers are not good, I believe they are decent and loud enough for most purposes. 3. the performance is great, i5 paired with ssd gives great output in performance boost. 4. battery life is not as good as promised by Acer but I'm getting a decent 7 hrs of battery life in moderate conditions w...

"Pros - Delivers good performance, solid build quality, excellent battery backup, backlit keyboard, lightweight and looks professional. Cons - Few ergonomic issues in keyboard and track pad. They are not as obvious and smooth as per my preference, average speakers, below average fingerprint sensor.  Overall - A good buy if you are looking for performance, you have a tight budget, and you are ok with the cons I listed above.",4
After seeing good reviews and rating I planned to buy this product but really I am very disappointed with this product... sound quality is very low you can't hear property without head phones or speakers. Please don't buy this product. after some 6-7 months my laptop's touch pad and keyboard is also not working . please don't buy this product.,1
sound is very low... except sound everything is good,4
writing my personal experience after this device for almost 3 months awesome battery life 8-9 hours after full charge nice design and sharp display good performance with 8gb ram and i5 processor superfast bootup with ssd hardlt takes 5 seconds to get ready  third class finger print reader wrost experience with keyboard also i have lenovo laptop that i was bought at 22k has better keyboard than this  overall it's 3 out of 5 from me,3
got this for office use. No frills and super fast!,5
"Thin and light, the overall form factor of the laptop describe being 15.6 size is a bit smaller. The display is quite enough with good viewing angles and better than most HP/DELL Laptops is this range. The body is made of plastic but trust me it's amazing. I use this laptop for meetings/office work/surfing/movies. Ryzen 3500u is good enough to handle this kind of usage and in this form factor makes it a good deal. Right side numeric keypad is an added benefit for users!",5
"Fabulous design, premium matte finish, looks awesome Build quality is good, plastic but solid built Fast processor and ssd makes operating smooth Display is good .. Supports all gestures Battery 6-7 hrs Normal heating ... Justifies the price overall good for medium user  CONS camera not that good",5
"First look is impressive, very thin and lightweight, Dispaly is bright and good, superfast performance with windows 10 and SSD with 8 gb of ram, Reason of 4 star is I found some heating on the back, It is quite acceptable for me as I'm normal user, but not sure it is temporary or permanent, One more thing is it has inbuilt battery so you can't remove it, Overall good performance and worthy product.",4
Great laptop.... Black variant is looking like a cheaper one.. but great performance. Average camera..,4
"The laptop looks good overall - Thin bezel, ag ips display and the slightly slanted keyboard, got a very good laptop bag. Found some issues with the laptop - Fan noise is too loud when the speed goes high, and heat is getting blown on to the bottom side of the screen. Dont know if this is a good idea in the long run. Office subscription is only for 1 year ** its office personal not h and s, but you get extra apps like onedrive, onenote etc. The laptop speaker sound quality isnt that great. I... READ MORE",4
"Laptop has Matt Looks and design is very decent Overall a good deal. This is only the first day review, everything found excellent except some heat at the battery side. Will try to elaborate more after using it for a week.  It has been now more than a week and now I am decreasing one star as it really heats at the back and yes there is a little sound of Fan's noise as well. Rest the laptop is really fast and happening. Overall it's ok till now.  Let's see further.",4
Must buy product . I have searched a lot and spent 1 month in searching best product for me . I am an Engineer and i was looking for good performance Laptop and Finally i bought this and happy with its performance,5
"Excellent product in the range of 45-50k. Looks are premium, display was decent and good enough as compared to other laptops in this budget range. It was mentioned that it contains office but the truth is it gives an office 365 subscription for one year after which we need to renew (drawback). Sound quality was not up to the expectations, it is not that loud enough which we can get from the competitors. It delivers an exceptional performance with fast booting time and can run all the applicat... READ MORE",4
"Excellent Laptop by Vaio Display is very good with thin bezzels. Processor is very fast, it takes just 5-6 seconds to start the pc Laptop bag given with laptop is of nice fabric quality Overall highly satified with the product",5
"I have been searching for a laptop from few days and I finally decided to go for VAIO e15 . First thanks to flipkart for fast delivery. After opening the laptop I was astonished it's really awesome. It has a great display, booting was very fast because of the AMD ryzen 5, decent battery back up 4 to 5 hours depending on our usage , body made up of plastic but looks premium and backlit keyboard was good. Speakers volume could have been better.",4
Battery Backup is Normal as in any laptop. full Charging takes below 2.5 hours to 3 hours. Small & cute laptop with Superb design. every feature are available in the laptop as in any other laptops.also MS office free for 1 year..start up is very fast.. Loved it üëç,4
This laptop is very good at this price range.performance is top notch Ryzen 5 processor handle task very easily.Design is also awesome and build quality is very good.,5
Love this laptop in this price with gorgeous display 14 inches. Nice back-lit for use at night and as well very smooth working finger print. Over all nice laptop please buy.,5
"This is value for money when buying; after sales is nothing to expect. Personal use, it is best for me @ 30.8k investment. Overall as par with other laptops in the price range 35 to 40K. Speakers are improved a lot when compared with my one year old i3, 8th generation avita laptop, though not upto the mark. the only battery backup at performance mode it counts 2.5 to 4 hrs max. Nothing to worry about display; works fine with Ryzen5. C-type usb does not charge neither laptop nor smartphone. I... READ MORE",4
"Wifi connection is not working properly hardware issue, also i m experiencing differences in performance compare to top laptop brands like dell, asus, hp lenovo, it feels like avita is a boy laptop not for professionals",1
"Awesome performance, better than the i5 version. Design wise it is as comfortable as MacBook",5
"Awesome laptop in this price range at 30k... Ryzen processor is best as compared to intel or any other...guys Dont think, go ahead with it... I really love it",5
My Review After 1 Day use.... Battery is not enough But Good 3 to 3.30 hour's and this prise Range this avista laptop beat every laptop....Avita Rezan 5 laptop Size Too Small but easy to carry may Rating is 5 star.....üòçüòò  Battery 3 to 4 hours after hard working use,5
"Good at the price point, however it heats and fan noise is significant under minimal usage, please buy if and only if you are fine with that....as well speaker is average or below average. Performance won't be an issue , untill and unless you are doing something real heavy",3
"I got this laptop under 32390 I really like this laptop best booting performance and smooth fast Display is awesome Speaker and camera are just pretty good Sometimes its heating very high u need cool lad for its very heating using while normal software its the only drawback of laptop Btw overall its best budget and value of money laptop for who want to normal and pretty high user, i recommend all them buddy.",5
Cons: 1. Wifi speed is very slow.Display quality is Average. (Need help to fix) 2. Not very fast with Optane Memory. Software loads as normal hdd .  Pros: 1. But configuration and getup is good in this Price range while comparing with others.That is good.  Overall It's a good product.  ** One more thing It's a slow delivery by Flipkart. Need to be Improved.,3
The Laptop is very good at this range.It has a good and strong processor of i5.The laptop has a very much well design.One problem is about battery.It works 5-5.5 hrs with medium to low display and 4.5-5 hr with high display.Rest everything is good.Its wifi speed is also very high.,5
"It's a 5 star product. Display quality is awesome, sound quality is better, the design looks awesome. Fast processor. In this price you get most of the features which you would have rather paid extra to some different brand. Hmm...camera quality is very good. Apart from, flipkart service was good in handling my query. One imp part I would like to mention that till your return period is over, keep the packing with you.",5
Awesome one!!! Worth for Money...,5
Very well designed. Performance was good. Very nice picture quality but sound quality was bit low. Battery backup is low except battery and sound everything is superb. I suggest to buy,5
Worth of money..... amazing one.,5
"one of the questions says, ms office is pre-activated. that is false, ms office is prompting for activation. and we have to buy it separately.",1
Laptop was very fast. There is an extra slot to upgrade memory. But if u want to put an m.2 ssd u need to remove optane memory. But the laptop is fast even without ssd. Good for programming. Cons: 1. The keyboard was not good 2. No baklit for keyboard 3. Ms office is not activated 4. Not for gaming or video editing or photo editing,4

It has decent screen quality and body quality. The fan sound is amazing while loading the CPU. Lightning Speed. Let's see the lifetime of the new VAIO series.

Amazing laptop. Processing is very fast & looking good,5
Mainly the RAM should be much more atleast 8 GB in the price level and giving a 4 GB RAM is utter nonsense.Activation of MS Suite is tedious as the system hinders you despite providing a valid MS account .Rest all is fine.,4

So if you dont do much of work and if you want it for your parents then its good ,but if you are a student then you can try some other option ...",3

Nice very super product and nice performance Battery backup nice,5
To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.üëåüëåüëå,5
Mi 9i is good no loss it is very good mobile any one can take this it's very good I am happy thank you,5
"Nice mobile, good battery backup, camera satisfactory, display is awesome, sound quality satisfactory, nice internet speed. Best mobile at this range. Highly recommended",5
Nice product fits in your budget segment. 1) Battery back up is quite good 2) Nice camera 3) Not a gaming phone 4) Great for normal usage,4
"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3.",4
"Good handy phone with decent performance. Good for the first time smartphone users. battery backup is pro level, network availability is good,not that heavy. i prefer this to c11 as it has CGG protection.",4
Good product in perfect value of money. I thought the charger is c-type. But actually it is not. All features are new and sufficient with the low budget phone.,4
This is such a budget friendly product.It also makes a good first impression as the overall look of the device is really impressive.The device also provides a decent display and camera with a storage space of 32 GB.,5
"Let me get straight to the point. From day 1 this phone hangs.multitasking performance is very bad.. sometimes wifi gets disconnected automatically..apps like whatsapp take 15 seconds to open.and flipkart 20-25 seconds. In the time of usb type c,we are getting micro usb.charging takes a long time..and 2 gb ram is not sufficient to run apps..phone is good for just to make calls..and do light works.not meant for multi tasking.",1
Poco C3 is way better not promoting the product . Not worth the price ur paying battery backup is not good 5000mah but still its making no difference with light usage YouTube and what's app I just get 1day performance not good .In 2021 still 2GB cost cutting ? It's a nope don't buy this,1

"Mobile was really great. If you are buying for your grand parents it will be a best option for them to upgrade from feature phone. But don't expect much from this phone as it was a basic model it can perform good but not excellent.

REDMI note 9 really valuable products by Xiaomi. A very Strong Hardware Very good battery performance. I have many phones by different brands.but REDMI is really a strong hardware . I think the name is Enough REDMI.,5
Camera 3/5 Battery 5/5 Display 4/5 Performance 5/5  Phone is far Good though its HD+Resolution its UI manages good Viewing angles And It has a massive battery but weight distribution made is good and looks like some what weight less  Note:There is one bug in Realme ui 2.0 which came as a trial version in device after one security update. Pictures which taken in Default camera is over sharpened and not looked like naturally I hope They will fill this in next update.,4
Phone is really good must buy guys... Highly recommended üôÇüôÇüôÇ and the delivery tym is also fast my mom really like it... Traffic product,5
I'm writing this review after 3 months of usage. PRONS:- 1. Front selfie camera is best It's just 8MP but really gives resolution of 32 MP. 2. The phone is still not lagging and performance is good enough. CONS:- 1. The back camera is not so good. It's just o.k and up to mark. 2. The resolution of phone is not so good. 3. The look is just satisfying l. 4. Gives good experience while playing games but not so great feel for gamers.,4
"The phone is really good at this range. Main advantage is the battery , even continuous usage of it will make the full charge last atleast 2 days. The charger is bit big , might not fit in every plug sockets. It does take time to get fully charged but the awesome battery life covers it all.  Nearby share, realme share , bedtime mode , access to international data without a sim card - these are some features available in it.

"Thank you Flipkart for delivering the phone before time. I loved the matte finish on the back which helps to get less scratches on it. I loved all the features of this phone and it feels so smooth while using! The delivery boy was a good guy too and spoke politely.  I loved the camera, battery and display. It'd be better if the phone has a FHD+ display, but that's okay. The bigger battery, bigger screen and bigger camera satisfy me properly.",5

Good product in this price Thanks to fkipkart for fast delivery Phone is good looking 2 days battery backup Very light weight But no internal memory No what's app No Facebook But overall good product in this price,4
Its very straight i wud like to say that its a gem buying in lieu of peanuts. A small handy phone which has all basic thngs and sounds ok in quality. Keypad is little hard but it will be ok after use. Its small light weight phone solves all the purpose. It needs a memory card to work coz it doesnt have any internal memory. Headset given is not that great but u shudnt expect more in this price. In short its a perfect standby set. Go for it.,5
Nice product Things u will get are:  Phone charger(usb detachable) headphones(ok quality)  over all everything is fine till now after 3 months of usage for those who dont knw to use smart phone can easily take this comparative low price.,4
Nice mobile,5
It doesnot have real whatsapp it just sends the messeges through normal carrier provider..other than that pritty decent basic device to buy.,2

Battery backup is also good, lasts easily for a day and a half.",5

"If you really want a fast charging phone, this one is not for you. Fast charging phones are Vooc based and above 20W. Oppo A53 (128G) is taking around 3hrs to fully charge.

I bought a Moto one action last year (128G) and cheaper than this but trust me Moto is better compare to this Oppo A53 in terms of app responsiveness and AI.",3

To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.,4

A budget phone with G85 chipset is definitely a great bargain. There's no lag in the phone in day to day task. The display although not 1080p is really crisp and bright and good enough for watching movies. For the price it is selling for it's a good bargain.,5

I'm writing this review after 3 months of usage. PRONS:- 1. Front selfie camera is best It's just 8MP but really gives resolution of 32 MP. 2.

The look is just satisfying l. 4. Gives good experience while playing games but not so great feel for gamers.,4

Pictures which taken in Default camera is over sharpened and not looked like naturally I hope They will fill this in next update.,4
Phone is really good must buy guys... Highly recommended üôÇüôÇüôÇ and the delivery tym is also fast my mom really like it... Traffic product,5
I'm writing this review after 3 months of usage. PRONS:- 1. Front selfie camera is best It's just 8MP but really gives resolution of 32 MP. 2. The phone is still not lagging and performance is good enough. CONS:- 1. The back camera is not so good. It's just o.k and up to mark. 2. The resolution of phone is not so good. 3. The look is just satisfying l. 4. Gives good experience while playing games but not so great feel for gamers.,4
"The phone is really good at this range. Main advantage is the battery , even continuous usage of it will make the full charge last atleast 2 days. The charger is bit big , might not fit in every plug sockets. It does take time to get fully charged but the awesome battery life covers it all.  Nearby share, realme share , bedtime mode , access to international data without a sim card - these are some features available in it.  Had read some reviews regarding it camera , and the thing is , the c... READ MORE",4
"Thank you Flipkart for delivering the phone before time. I loved the matte finish on the back which helps to get less scratches on it. I loved all the features of this phone and it feels so smooth while using! The delivery boy was a good guy too and spoke politely.  I loved the camera, battery and display. It'd be better if the phone has a FHD+ display, but that's okay. The bigger battery, bigger screen and bigger camera satisfy me properly.",5

"I'll not pretend to be an expert and review things as per their utility to me. I don't play a single game on my phone, so don't need heavy GPU and clock numbers etc etc. I do use the phone as an average young adult, making frequent videocalls. This phone's battery is an ally for at least a day and a half. Charging as many have stated via the Dash charger may not be as quick as many rivals in the game, for a good 3 hours of charge... this phone will do you good for a day and a half of moderate...

1)Helio G85-The highlighting feature which makes performance flawless at this range. Ram could have been 6gb but 4gb is pretty good if you aren't targetting too heavy games 2)18 w fast charging- This is too bad I guess for a this generation phone since it takes almost takes 3.5 hrs to completely charge the 6000mah huge battery.2-2.5 he's could have been pretty good since it mentions fast charging. 3)The camera performance is descent although it struggles in low light which is common for its p...

Battery backup is also good, lasts easily for a day and a half.",5
"Been using this phone for a week now. All features are great; it's light on the hand. Would have preferred a complimentary back silicon cover but oh well it's a good mobile for this price point.

After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.,4
I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.,4

"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product.",4
I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.,5
I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä,5
"it's a basic phone you can ask for from a reliable company. Nokia was the king then. but still I would say that it doesn't feel the way Nokia phones used too. The typing isn't smooth as it used to be. rest all its good. Talking about the games it just snake. rest is paid. Charging and the aux port is not surfaced with the body so dust and water would easily find there way in. It supports the full big SIM card, not the nano or micro ones. Also the battery case isn't that easy to open.",4
nice phone for this price... i like it. its worthy and good battery.. best feature phone on this range ..,5

You can really use it roughly......One more guarantee for this mobile is,you will get one year replacement warranty for this mobile....If you want a basic mobile just go for it......Muniramu",5
Phone built quality is good . Screen is good in size . Sound qaulity is very good for both calling and notifications. But no increase nd decrease option for screen brightness is lack point. Otherwise overall a good package .,4

Very very very good phone go for it.At this price range it is very good and nice phone...,5
Dimensity 700 is good at this price but not 30w charging. Realme 8 has Super Amoled display on screen finger print but it has IPS LCD and side mount finger print. Realme 8 has Quad camera setup with 64 mp sensor it has tripal cameras with 48mp main sensor. Realme Focus on only 5G and nothing on other features. Now realme become costly like other smartphone company,2

If your priority is 5G then blindly go for this.. considering the price realme 8 5G is the cheapest 5G phone and also support lots of 5G bands...otherwise in this price range there are lots of better 4G smartphone available in the market... Cons 1. Charger is only 18W which is slow in 2021 2. Screen is LCD but quality is good 3.Camera quality is not best.. its avarage Pros 1.5G future proof with most of the band support 2. The phone tick most of the boxes considering price,3
Battery is superb but camera and display doesnt feeel good as we accpect and sad for gamer pubg only SMOoTH ULTRA 30fps So your gun recoil ll not be smooth as In 120hz display phone  Design is good For this price segment 5g phone is good Company apps occupied ram of 8% But rom is 128gb thats the good point  üîãbattery 5* üì± display 3* üéöcpu 4* üì∑ 1.5* Design 3.5*,3

Dimensity 700 is good at this price but not 30w charging. Realme 8 has Super Amoled display on screen finger print but it has IPS LCD and side mount finger print. Realme 8 has Quad camera setup with 64 mp sensor it has tripal cameras with 48mp main sensor. Realme Focus on only 5G and nothing on other features. Now realme become costly like other smartphone company,2

If your priority is 5G then blindly go for this.. considering the price realme 8 5G is the cheapest 5G phone and also support lots of 5G bands...otherwise in this price range there are lots of better 4G smartphone available in the market... Cons 1. Charger is only 18W which is slow in 2021 2. Screen is LCD but quality is good 3.Camera quality is not best.. its avarage Pros 1.5G future proof with most of the band support 2. The phone tick most of the boxes considering price,3
Battery is superb but camera and display doesnt feeel good as we accpect and sad for gamer pubg only SMOoTH ULTRA 30fps So your gun recoil ll not be smooth as In 120hz display phone  Design is good For this price segment 5g phone is good Company apps occupied ram of 8% But rom is 128gb thats the good point  üîãbattery 5* üì± display 3* üéöcpu 4* üì∑ 1.5* Design 3.5*,3

First time I bought a realme phone and I'm so happy about this product.such a sleek design and the phone is slim and stylish. The display and features are more than good enough.

Simply awesome device. Performance of this mobile is mind blowing. I'm playing pubg in Ultra HD with extreme smoothness. And I have seen in most of the reviews that the camera quality was bad. So that attaching the photos that I captured on my mobile Poco X3 Pro. So that you can decide whether it is good or bad. You feels like that you're in a mini theatre with these loud stereo speakers. Mobile design also looking good other than in the website or app. And it's display was very very ... READ MORE,5
I will share my review after using this for more than 15 days The product is what you expect The performance is amazing but the only thing which is not good is miui 12 i hope that the next miui version will fix the minor lag which is only due to nonoptimized software. The camera is not that bad you will get a decent picture with enough details and i don't think that i can really differentiate between the 64 mp realme camera and this poco camera so go for it also you can easily use gcam which...

Awesome performance Just like Flagship . processor is good  But too too too much HEATING ISSUES as well as fast charging is not so fast  who said camera is bad indeed camera is best  performance display everything awesome will edit after 1 month uses,4
Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.,3
Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...,5
"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ... READ MORE",4

"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N... READ MORE",5
"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo... READ MORE",4
Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.,4
Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.,3
The phone is really good also performance all is well but camera is average if you want to a baget phone or camera is not important so you can buy definitely this phone this is my honest review,3

"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ...",2
Startup is very long  Battery is not good  Working speed also no good .  This is the worst experience in laptops I ever used .  I didn't use first 15 days due to some person reasons now till then my return period is over .  Please I strongly recommend don't buy this laptop,2
"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy.",2
Booting is very very slow,2
"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor.",2
"The laptop review is written after a months usage 1. Windows home edition does not have ms office which is needed for any student: misleading information by Flipkart/ HP as they should specify. 2. Computer booting takes considerable time feel that I should have taken SSD rather than 1 TB HDD, seems a bit slow in response (maybe due to Ryzen 5 processors when compared to i5) 3. Very heavy weighing laptop 4. Scroll pad does not have separate buttons below so again left and right clicks are hav...",2
Too slow nd charge drain out very soon not worth it!!,2
I think it is refreshing,2
"Sent a defective laptop after placing an order it took just 4 days to deliver the product but when I applied for returns its been 8 days still the product is with me, the procedure to return anything is pathetic product is good only need to install an ssd for better percormance",2
I am Android developer running Android studio taking lot of ram also sound problem if I run my emulator making sound not run properly waste of money don't buy it,2
Not for gamers every game lagging display is very good but when I started playing games like gta valorant both are lagging after few minutes now tell me what's the advantage of buying gaming laptop if I facing these problems,2
"Some games are lagging , i dont know why this is happening. I am not impressed regarding this product. Build quality is not good . heat control is no doubt good. Battery average. Charging cable is too small.. No colours variety is available, disgusting black Colour.",2
Everytime i am paying valorant after 3-4 minutes the screen is showing locking & shuts down... After 1 months of use the screen is getting backlight bleeding & dead pixels,2

"I purchased this Laptop looking at all the reviews, and also after going through expert comments and reviews on different websites. I really like the design, look and aesthetics of the Laptop.  However, when it comes to performance, I am terribly upset with the boot speed.

Booting Takes Much time (more than 5 min). Speaker sounds are very low. system performance is low.  Display is good. Battery Backup is okk as of now since the use is less and gaming is not done. Could have included SSD Hard disk.,2
Not really satisfied with the product and the entire process till possession of it. Laptop takes forever to boot up. The response time is very slow. I don't know if you can run games smoothly takes forever to open Chrome.,2
I was using this laptop since September 2020 it hang a lot,2
"Laptop functions quite slow, starting from power ON. Even same with browsing. I observe buffer. Takes lot time to open application and switch between them.. Not upto the mark. Facing issues while using office tools. Not worth the investment of 55K.",2
The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.,2
There is only 5.9 gb usable ram in this laptop...,2

Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage,2
Some game like frozen 4 is not run nice till now bad is that the 8gb Ram is mentioned but 2gb is already use By system we get only 5.88gb Ram usable gaming experience is not good not bad also some game run smoothly but some are not,2
After 6 month of User It‚Äôs really slow Takes lot of time to start,2
Everything is fine but laptop is slow in performance.,2

"Not very satisfying performance, I got a damaged products for the first time and the replacement process in one word ""Degaster"". Finally after more then 50 call I got the replacement after 18 days. So simply avoid the product.",2
The laptop is very slow probably due to so many adm drivers. Look is very cool but very low grade performance.,2

Laptop is really good. I've bought it 2.5 years ago and working fine for first year and then suddenly I was unable to start my Mac. Display was not working but my good luck that it was still in warrenty and thus they have replaced motherboard and it started working again and after exactly one year I'm facing same issue but this time they told me that I need to replace the motherboard which coast me 42000.  I suggest not to buy this laptop.,2
"I have used all Apple products and my experience is quite satisfactory. But about Macbook Air 2017 model, let me confess, even though the hardware is quite satisfactory, Mac OS is not up to the mark. First and foremost issue is, its OS is not user friendly like iphone OS. It is hell and heaven difference between Mac OS (Mojave) and iphone OS. Sound quality, form factor, battery even display is very good. You can easily use But you will have to struggle to get a simple thing done. I do not f...",2
I am posting this 1 star not for the laptop but for Flipkart..They keep exchange offer and expect that customers will give them a brand new product in return.The pick up guy comes and cancels for scratches,2

Only a show off product,2
"don't buy MacBook online, keyboard not working ,not repairable only replaceable",2
Came with a bad battery life. Dies pretty quickly.,2
The flap just falls back if you open it a bit more than a right angle. Happens for all the Macs ordered through Flipkart.,2
If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.,2
"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad.",2
Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.,2
I think window is better system Crashes,2
Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.,2

Very very very slow.,2
Slow Laptop,2
Bat,2
After using it for a month now I can say it's too slow even in day to day tasks. I don't know with 4 gb of ram and 1 tb of hard disk how a laptop can work too slow. I also think AMD Ryzen 3 processor performance is not up to the mark it's too slow u must go with intel processors.,2

Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...,2

Phone shows slow charging and takes overnight for full charge. Camera is so so .Battery last not more than 15 hours though limited use.,2
Specifications say camera is 48Mp but actual setting in camera shows 12mp (48 mp quad pixel) images don't look like 48 mp. Camera shows black waves oftentimes. For videos when camera tries to focus video becomes blurry. Other features are good. Good responsive screen. Finger print screen shot is nice feature.good battery. But If buying for good camera don't go for it.,2
Camera is not so much good like 48MP and front camera is also not satisfactory. According to my point of view they are making costumers fool,2

"Before this model, I was used moto e4 plus and camera of that model is only 13MP and this is 48MP. Quality of camera is not this much satisfied. 13MP of e4 plus is much more good from this one. Same for battery backup. In both mobile battery is 5000 MAH. But backup in very much good in e4 plus. My suggestion is, if you are planning for buy this one than I recommend you should go with moto e4 plus not with e7 plus.",2

I personally font suggest this phone reason is lowest quality of camera and the main thing is second camera is literally not working and flashlight is also low and it will take around 3.5 hours to get fully charged. I personally don't recommend this phone.,2
Camera quality is very poor,2
Camera spec given 48MP but practically there is no quality Which is in product promotions.,2
Sound is great but quality is not that great But at this price range 24 hours backup and fast charging So worth to buy IAM EDITING THE REVIEW AFTER 1 MONT OF USE THE RIGHT EAR PICE STOPED WORKING (THE SOUND IS VERY LESS ). AND RIGHT YEAR PIECE IS GOOD *Even the support team is not answering*,2
"Honest review after using - charging and price is at the best but sound , bass and built quality is very very poor. Especially bass is at zero and sound is also not good. I will not recommend this product to anyone",2
"BASS IS JUST OK, NOT SO GOOD. I'M CURRENTLY USING MIVI THUNDERBEATS FROM PAST 6 MONTHS AND I CAN SURELY SAY THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN NEARBY THE THUNDERBEATS. BASS QUALITY IS VERY POOR AND BUTTONS ARE HARD TO PRESS,",2
Honest review !!!!  battery backup is good There is no bass only Sound quality is poor Not as loud its should be And there is no mivi logo on battery compartment As it's shown in the images Magnets are below average Feels cheap My old Samsung wired earphones which costs only 400 rupees sound better then these  Mivi disspointed me Worst neckband ever that I've tried Plz look out other neckbands,2
Product is not as expected...,2
My left ear piece is making crackle noise other than that sound quality is good 1.Bass is ok not for bass lovers 2.Mid's is best for the price. 3.Best performance is at 60 to 70 % of volume above that music gets a bit rough 4.Best in quality . 5.only for melody songs. Returned only for that crackle noise from Left ear piece,2
Really it's a very very bad product...waste of mone. When you call someone one or receive call of someone it doesn't work properly ...I mean the other person on your call can't hear you properly. But the best part is long battery life,2
Base is not good at per cometment,2
"Very bad product it doesn't even connect with my tv , connection is very poor , if you want neckband go with boat rockerz 255 the are best at this price.",2

"1.Sound quality is very good 2. But Product design and visibility/ appearance is very poor like local product 3. By seeing it , can‚Äôt say it last more than 3 months , Rest will use and update 4.

This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...,5
Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....,5
AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much,5
It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå,5
"Its an absolute beast if u know what are the necessary steps to follow after completing the installation of your laptop...  Make sure you update all the drivers and specifically windows bios and nvidia drivers, because it enhances the performance very much , i myself have felt the same ...Just download a software called driver booster which is free and a great soft indeed it scans for all available driver updates and installs them , also it has a game turbo power option which releases some ra...",5
This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä,5
This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.,5
"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa...",5
greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience,5
Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.,5
"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good.....",5
It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..,5
"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners",5
Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .,5
"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram",5
"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale.",5
"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ...",5
Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...,5
"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance.",5
"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get..",5
Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance,5
"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB",5
I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...,5
Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic,5
"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ...",5
One of tha Best laptop for Gaming and also for office work  Pros... Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself.. Then this laptop will be Beast performance.  Cons.... Average webcam Boot time max 30sec... Only 5.9gb Ram available,5
"It is just awesome laptop good design, excellent display,nice graphics It is an awesome product I just loved it",5
Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.,5
At this prize Intel is giving best laptops. But for 50k ryzen 5 3550h quad core is less At the prize of 45k other laptop is giving ryzen 5 hexa core,5
"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product.",5
Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.,5
Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.,5
"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart.",5
"First thing first Do not rush for games, do windows updates first Updates will take time even after having a good internet connection. Once updates are done, it will completely turns into beast.

pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it,5
Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!,5
The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...,5
"Good laptop with being able to run most games... Due to hardisk ,the laptop is very slow.booting time takes much time...but if you add. Ssd and move is to ssd. Then this laptop will be fast to boot..comes with a dedicated graphics. To play AAA title games...Due to AMD processor Vega 8 uses 2gb ram so u only get around 6 GB to use.. DEFINITELY if u upgrade ram and ssd this laptop will be damn fast....I got this laptop for 49890... Antiglare display is so good... Battery backup is so good... Du...",5
If you are go for a decent laptop then I should recommended this as described there is a huge and most of the amount of power that can be delivered by a AMD ryzen 5 3500H processor can be processed and there is a huge lot of processing power and many more decent display decent power backup for 4.5 or and a decent multitasking and full HD display which can be a great pleasure for who can do Photoshop and title gamer why most of us for follow by HDD that can be slow your laptop so you can be go...,5
There is 1 slot available u can upgrade ur ram and boost your performance i buyed 8gb hyper ram and boom its amazing u can stay with its 8gab ram no prblm laptop is tooo good,5
Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.,5
Excellent product super value for money I mean this is a all rounder though u get gtx 1650 ti in competition but then is jus about 5 % gap go with this upgrade ram and ssd and good to go,5
"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice.",5
excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.,5
Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram,5
07/09/20 today I got my laptop and it's design is fabulous looking too good. Really lite in weight display is descent for a hdd it is little bit slow but it has a nvme m.2 port for upgrading and a ddr4 extra ram slots so you can upgrade whenever you want to.best laptop for gaming and and work.ryzen processor really works well and that purple colour combinations is really eye catching,5
"A great laptop at this price segment with hp branding. I would suggest to go for ssd variant not with hdd one it takes around 15 -20 sec to work properly at time of boot. Battry is decent you can watch videos for 6-7 hrs i guess But dont expect gaming without charging  Conclusion- nice product if you want to do all work gaming , editing, coding and video watching",5
Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.,5
PEOPLE LISTEN.... MANY SAY IT'S SLOW AMD WASTE OF MONEY AND CREATE A RUCKUS IN THE BUYER'S MIND.... SEE... IT HAS SLOWER BOOTING TIME ONLY BECAUSE 5400 RPM HDD.... JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS... MAXIMUM 25 SECS BOOT TIME AFTER THIS... MOSTLY 15 TO 18 SECS...... THE LAPPY IS A SEXY BEAST TO BEHOLD....,5
Awesome.. Must buy the product.,5
"excellent product , just go for it if u are a gamer, basically i m using it for office purpose in these lockdown days.",5

Laptop is really pretty first of all. I have played sekiro and mk 11 till now both are working on max. Only issue i am having is of ram the system gets overloaded very easily because of ram. Maybe if we just upgrade it all will be fine. Overall everything is working as expected.,5
A pc like this comes in a lifetime!!!! Very Very happy to purchase this . My dream of gaming came true. Games like The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt and specially Grand Theft Auto V runs beautifully. Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that. Hope upgrading it will fix this issue otherwise everyt...,5

I'm in love with this laptop üíúüíúüíú,5
Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.,5
Just awsoom Looks 10/10 Performance best Sound awesome Just love with pavilion,5
The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product,5
Nice to handle,5
Great quality and good looking device.,5

You definitely need a SSD card if you buy this laptop. It has 2.1GHZ processor. If you buy this laptop for gaming than go for 3.1GHZ processor in this category or install a SSD card. Otherwise it will work Slow. Just that processor is slow otherwise it's good laptop to buy.,5

I expected little more in this price range becoz if you invest 55k money in any pc and you will feel disappointed with its functionality,, it is not fair.",5

Battery backup is not much as i expected, and the usb ports are only 2 in this laptop that's the one problems i facing, but the laptop is very much better to compared some other products because in this price range gtx 1650 with 4gb graphics card is not available in any other laptops so if you want 60k budget laptop the buy this",5

Very good laptop at its price range Best design Battery ok No doubt you can go for it,5
Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time,5
Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient,5
The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k,5
Simply superb üòçüòä,5
Best in all way....,5
Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance,5

Looks premium but gets oil marks everywhere. Ssd is a must if you want fast loading speed. Upgrade ram also if you do multitasking of heavy apps,5

"This laptop is completely an insane beast,i loved it, the performance is very good and the battery back-up is also good. However, firstly to get the best out of it, please update all the laptop drivers i.e graphics, processor, mother board, bios etc, the updates will take over 2-3 hours on speed internet,  Also, because of of the 1 TB HDD, the performance is quite low, but once the laptop is upgrade to SSD and extra 8GB or 16GB RAM it is completely insane beast.

"If you are going to buy this order a 8gb 2400mhz ram with it else the ram will bottleneck the GTX 1650 and u may think that the laptop is not efficient, cuz of integrated graphics only 5.88gb of ram available  a perfect classic gamming laptop , u can use this for both professional use and gamming .it doesn't look aggressive as other gamming laptop . Great performance , with hdd it just takes 20 or 19sec to boot up initially Display - is superb it has led display Sound - loud and clear Batter...",5

Best Product Truly,5
Just amazing,5
The best,5
"The laptop is great overall and the GTX1650ti can run most modern AAA games, display is awesome and performance is good... BUT A RAM AND SSD UPGRADE IS MUST... And battery life is somewhat short but that's expected from a gaming laptop.  Get at least a RAM upgrade (if u don't mind longer booting and loading times) and this beast is ready to go",5
In this price range You can get this as a best deal... the battery backup could be better... otherwise product is best üî•,5
The heating is more and gaming are lagaing But good,5
Received the product within 03 days of placing order. Performance is great considering the price point. AMD does a great job and is comparable to i5 9th gen. Overall recommended.,5

Great performance and looking too good,5
"Best laptop in this price range . If you are playing games casually then this must be your choice. Initially the games will get lag but if u add 8 GB ram upgrade the laptop works smoothly any games at 16 GB ram. So ram upgrade is must. I play PUBG PC, GTA 5, Valorant , Warzone,Apex Legends,Fortnite,CS Go, Watchdogs 2,RDR 2etc.... You can play any high specs game only with a ram upgrade. Battery is the only problem with this lap but while u r playing games just plug in the charger and play you...",5
Good value of money,5
Except battery all are good in this price range... U can buy it,5
"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb",5
Too good lapi.. I love it,5
Got what I Want.,5

Very nice model with good performance,5
It's pretty decent laptop. The only problem is it doesn't support hardware virtualization. It means you won't be able to use virtual box or VMware. Just think before you purchase,5

"It's excellent product from HP. I was a little worried due to display Specs. But in practice it is stunning. Really good one. I have played over 144 Hz and literally no diff. is observable.  The laptop is prime by looks and touch. And particularly good in operation. A powerful and cheaper alternative against i5 based lapy.  My gaming experience is best at this system and I have been playing HQ games for the last 15 yrs. So, just go for it. Encourage HP and dealer for providing such a nice dea...",5

"The laptop isn't heavy as i thought it to be. Battery life on battery saver exceeds 7 hours without any issue. Touchpad works great. Was sceptical about going for ryzen 5 series, but the gaming and overall performance is just great. Display is good, not great but the design takes away the show. The backlit keyboard is nice, no rgb mode and i personally would prefer white light than this voilet kinda backlit keyboard, gives a bit of a eye strain. I would suggest cloning the OS in a ssd (it sup...",5

"Good laptop, Finishing superb. Booting time within 30- 35 secs and same for shutdown",5
"I got this laptop at Rs 49,000 at the time of big billion sale. The look is excellent. Surely, the screen is incomparable with other laptops at this rate. I have played Asphalt 9 in this laptop, the experience was fantastic due to its graphics card. The screen really, has wide angle view. There is absolutely no problem with hinges. Built up quality is excellent. Speaker is awesome (5 stars). Laptop heats very little during gamming. Finally, I am happy to purchased this laptop.",5
They say it's Gaming Laptop but to actually play games on it with a decent FPS (60-70) you have upgrade ram as well as install SSD!,5
"its a awesome laptop, only draw back is the battery, but that too is that bad, it does'nt heat up or anything, but if you play high graphical powered games like GTA 5, WATCHDOGS, etc, it last about only an hour in battery settings high performance. it does'nt lag or shuts down randomly. if you are looking for a reliable laptop with good graphics and high performance gaming. perfect laptop for you.",5
Nice laptop I recommend to buy,5
"Nice laptop, good performance,nice colour, backlight is good, nice looking",5

"Seems to working fine for now, and I've been using it for over a month. The display is just mesmerizing.  Even though you expect the gaming laptop to have good speed, you can't just pile up tasks on it and expect it to run smooth.  Also, a lot of people are complaining about the battery, which is absolutely ridiculous. The high grade cpu and GPU obviously take more energy than your regular potato pc. Also, if you run a heavy app, the laptop is bound to lose energy quickly.  Overall, a good pu...",5

Its a beast at this price. Go for it. I played GTA 5 and it ran smoothly but obviously not on ultra high graphics. It's good for everything mainly gaming. But you should upgrade your ram to 16gb for maximum performance.,5

I tried running android studio and this beauty handles it very smoothly. I didn't faced any lag or hang. so I fired up android emulator too just to know if it can handle or not. But surprisingly the machine handled that too. I was amazed. There's some lag on emulator but it still handles it and doesn't s...,5

I previously had one with 4 GB ram now I have the same config with 8gb. It works like a charm. Bit lag for Android studio and xcode. But that is ok since they are heavy softwares. Running simulators was pain in my 4 GB Mac but this one is pretty fast. If you are looking something for 4-5 years with medium to heavy use (I use my Macbook for 8-9 hours per day every day) and don't want to spend anything on maintenance Go buy it. Anyways got it for 51k in Diwali offer. But even for 62k it is bett...,5

"I used to make fun of Apple products being over priced and not worth the buy. I'd like to correct it, it is over priced but your spent on it is worth.

For those switching from Windows do go through a Mac tutorials as there are a lot of hidden features which you want to unveil. PROS: Awesome battery...",5
"It's superb for entertainment, watching movies & battery performances is so good I am very happy with that.One major problem is that for official work or for the Ph.D scholars I would think it's not good as most of the windows applications are not supported in mac Os system so it would be difficult to run app like Origin,Chemdraw,Peakfit apps (which are not available in apple store excepy chemdraw although you need to pay for this monthly).",5

"Well it's Apple, so you can't really go wrong with it. Battery definitely lasts for 10 hours. If you're a Windows user, Mac Os will take some getting used to. No Microsoft office, so that's always a downer. But all in all a great laptop. Can't stress how compact and travel friendly it is! Definitely worth the kidney I sold for this haha",5

"I bought this one for stability. This one is sleek, like super sleek and sexy. Although I miss the numeric keyboard but the stability, battery and performance makes up for it. And for those concerned about quality of screen, I will say it is far better than what reviewers here say. I mean I have worked on 15k laptop, a FHD laptop (my last one) and many others one. Even though pixel wise the display is a tad lower than FHD screen but nowhere bad like those windows HD screen. I love it. Other t...",5

"I have used all company laptops, dell, Sony vaio, hp, Lenovo etc . This is the best. Great quality and smooth buttery performance. Don‚Äôt go by the specs.

About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w...",5

Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.,5
"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ.",5
"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues.",5

Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!",5
"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money.",5

I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret,5
The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD,5

"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing",5
If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.,5

"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product.",5
Very nice product apple MacBook air,5
Superb product,5
The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.,5

But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice.",5

Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it,5
This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.,5

Nice product,5
A nic packing the packing is very good and I txn to flipcart fro the wolderfull product and there safety measures,5
The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself,5
No comments !! It's a macbook !!!!!,5

I have macbook Pro from organization but let me tell you this product is no less. Apple touch and feel is amazing. It may be 10k costly than other I5 products like dell etc but worth it.,5
"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for...",5

After using for more than 6 months I can say the product is good. Good for normal uses and weather home or office. In this price the product is good..but if some one looking for best Processor more than i5 Or long video edits or longer time cpu usage may this will not meet you requirements.,5
"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app).

I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock.

I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.,5
Worthy of money,5
Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.,5
Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone,5
Fall in love with this,5
Good,5
üëçüëçmust have even its 2020,5
Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.,5
I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.,5
Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it,5
Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.,5

"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other",5
Macbook air is awesome.,5
"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff.",5

Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...,5

Great laptop even in 2020,5
"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much",5

This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...,5
Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....,5
AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much,5
It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå,5
"Its an absolute beast if u know what are the necessary steps to follow after completing the installation of your laptop...  Make sure you update all the drivers and specifically windows bios and nvidia drivers, because it enhances the performance very much , i myself have felt the same ...Just download a software called driver booster which is free and a great soft indeed it scans for all available driver updates and installs them , also it has a game turbo power option which releases some ra...",5
This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä,5
This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.,5
"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa...",5
greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience,5
Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.,5
"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good.....",5
It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..,5
"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners",5
Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .,5
"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram",5
"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale.",5
"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ...",5
Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...,5
"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance.",5
"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get..",5
Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance,5
"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB",5
I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...,5
Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic,5
"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ...",5
One of tha Best laptop for Gaming and also for office work  Pros... Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself.. Then this laptop will be Beast performance.  Cons.... Average webcam Boot time max 30sec... Only 5.9gb Ram available,5
"It is just awesome laptop good design, excellent display,nice graphics It is an awesome product I just loved it",5
Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.,5
At this prize Intel is giving best laptops. But for 50k ryzen 5 3550h quad core is less At the prize of 45k other laptop is giving ryzen 5 hexa core,5
"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product.",5
Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.,5
Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.,5
"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart.",5
"First thing first Do not rush for games, do windows updates first Updates will take time even after having a good internet connection. Once updates are done, it will completely turns into beast. Lot of people are complaining about the gaming performance, but believe me there is no problm after updating the system I had play NFS PAYBACK, CSGO in high setting and it works like a charm The impression of this is laptop is very nice, hp gives a really very good quality of ips display here I got t...",5
"Ok, first of all this is gaming laptop, so if you are looking for gaming purpose then it's absolutely for you. Now Talking about battery performance then it's as usual like for all gaming laptops. Only thing is it doesn't come with MS office licence key. Overall laptop is worth it...üí• Have a nice day...",5
pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it,5
Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!,5
The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...,5
"Good laptop with being able to run most games... Due to hardisk ,the laptop is very slow.booting time takes much time...but if you add. Ssd and move is to ssd. Then this laptop will be fast to boot..comes with a dedicated graphics. To play AAA title games...Due to AMD processor Vega 8 uses 2gb ram so u only get around 6 GB to use.. DEFINITELY if u upgrade ram and ssd this laptop will be damn fast....I got this laptop for 49890... Antiglare display is so good... Battery backup is so good... Du...",5
If you are go for a decent laptop then I should recommended this as described there is a huge and most of the amount of power that can be delivered by a AMD ryzen 5 3500H processor can be processed and there is a huge lot of processing power and many more decent display decent power backup for 4.5 or and a decent multitasking and full HD display which can be a great pleasure for who can do Photoshop and title gamer why most of us for follow by HDD that can be slow your laptop so you can be go...,5
There is 1 slot available u can upgrade ur ram and boost your performance i buyed 8gb hyper ram and boom its amazing u can stay with its 8gab ram no prblm laptop is tooo good,5
Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.,5
Excellent product super value for money I mean this is a all rounder though u get gtx 1650 ti in competition but then is jus about 5 % gap go with this upgrade ram and ssd and good to go,5
"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice.",5
excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.,5
Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram,5
07/09/20 today I got my laptop and it's design is fabulous looking too good. Really lite in weight display is descent for a hdd it is little bit slow but it has a nvme m.2 port for upgrading and a ddr4 extra ram slots so you can upgrade whenever you want to.best laptop for gaming and and work.ryzen processor really works well and that purple colour combinations is really eye catching,5
"A great laptop at this price segment with hp branding. I would suggest to go for ssd variant not with hdd one it takes around 15 -20 sec to work properly at time of boot. Battry is decent you can watch videos for 6-7 hrs i guess But dont expect gaming without charging  Conclusion- nice product if you want to do all work gaming , editing, coding and video watching",5
Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.,5
PEOPLE LISTEN.... MANY SAY IT'S SLOW AMD WASTE OF MONEY AND CREATE A RUCKUS IN THE BUYER'S MIND.... SEE... IT HAS SLOWER BOOTING TIME ONLY BECAUSE 5400 RPM HDD.... JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS... MAXIMUM 25 SECS BOOT TIME AFTER THIS... MOSTLY 15 TO 18 SECS...... THE LAPPY IS A SEXY BEAST TO BEHOLD....,5
Awesome.. Must buy the product.,5
"excellent product , just go for it if u are a gamer, basically i m using it for office purpose in these lockdown days.",5

Laptop is really pretty first of all. I have played sekiro and mk 11 till now both are working on max. Only issue i am having is of ram the system gets overloaded very easily because of ram. Maybe if we just upgrade it all will be fine. Overall everything is working as expected.,5
A pc like this comes in a lifetime!!!! Very Very happy to purchase this . My dream of gaming came true. Games like The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt and specially Grand Theft Auto V runs beautifully. Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that. Hope upgrading it will fix this issue otherwise everyt...,5

I'm in love with this laptop üíúüíúüíú,5
Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.,5
Just awsoom Looks 10/10 Performance best Sound awesome Just love with pavilion,5
The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product,5
Nice to handle,5
Great quality and good looking device.,5

You definitely need a SSD card if you buy this laptop. It has 2.1GHZ processor. If you buy this laptop for gaming than go for 3.1GHZ processor in this category or install a SSD card. Otherwise it will work Slow. Just that processor is slow otherwise it's good laptop to buy.,5

"I edited my review after the heavy use like(working on Revit Architecture software).After installing Revit I especially feel it is laggy but if you add SSD then it works fine. Takes time for opening after shut down thats why I keep my pc on sleep mode in day time and shut down only in night. I expected little more in this price range becoz if you invest 55k money in any pc and you will feel disappointed with its functionality,, it is not fair.",5
Battery life is some much less...but in other categories ...the best ...main thing is u have to maintain good internet connection..,5

"The booting speed is very low i think add a ssd that problems will be solved. Battery backup is not much as i expected, and the usb ports are only 2 in this laptop that's the one problems i facing, but the laptop is very much better to compared some other products because in this price range gtx 1650 with 4gb graphics card is not available in any other laptops so if you want 60k budget laptop the buy this",5
It's one of the best in the market I bought it and planning to save some money and then add a ram 8 gb stick and an SSD 256 gb and yeah it's awesome value for money.,5

I happy with hp laptop and flipkart service. Thank you flipkart,5
Hmm somewht battry issue but performance is beast,5
Very good laptop at its price range Best design Battery ok No doubt you can go for it,5
Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time,5
Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient,5
The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k,5
Simply superb üòçüòä,5
Best in all way....,5
Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance,5

"If you are going to buy this order a 8gb 2400mhz ram with it else the ram will bottleneck the GTX 1650 and u may think that the laptop is not efficient, cuz of integrated graphics only 5.88gb of ram available  a perfect classic gamming laptop , u can use this for both professional use and gamming .it doesn't look aggressive as other gamming laptop .

The best,5
"The laptop is great overall and the GTX1650ti can run most modern AAA games, display is awesome and performance is good... BUT A RAM AND SSD UPGRADE IS MUST... And battery life is somewhat short but that's expected from a gaming laptop.  Get at least a RAM upgrade (if u don't mind longer booting and loading times) and this beast is ready to go",5
In this price range You can get this as a best deal... the battery backup could be better... otherwise product is best üî•,5
The heating is more and gaming are lagaing But good,5
Received the product within 03 days of placing order. Performance is great considering the price point. AMD does a great job and is comparable to i5 9th gen. Overall recommended.,5

"Best laptop in this price range . If you are playing games casually then this must be your choice. Initially the games will get lag but if u add 8 GB ram upgrade the laptop works smoothly any games at 16 GB ram. So ram upgrade is must. I play PUBG PC, GTA 5, Valorant , Warzone,Apex Legends,Fortnite,CS Go, Watchdogs 2,RDR 2etc.... You can play any high specs game only with a ram upgrade. Battery is the only problem with this lap but while u r playing games just plug in the charger and play you...",5
Good value of money,5
Except battery all are good in this price range... U can buy it,5
"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb",5

The laptop is prime by looks and touch. And particularly good in operation. A powerful and cheaper alternative against i5 based lapy.  My gaming experience is best at this system and I have been playing HQ games for the last 15 yrs. So, just go for it. Encourage HP and dealer for providing such a nice dea...",5

Was sceptical about going for ryzen 5 series, but the gaming and overall performance is just great. Display is good, not great but the design takes away the show. The backlit keyboard is nice, no rgb mode and i personally would prefer white light than this voilet kinda backlit keyboard, gives a bit of a eye strain.

"I got this laptop at Rs 49,000 at the time of big billion sale. The look is excellent. Surely, the screen is incomparable with other laptops at this rate. I have played Asphalt 9 in this laptop, the experience was fantastic due to its graphics card. The screen really, has wide angle view. There is absolutely no problem with hinges. Built up quality is excellent. Speaker is awesome (5 stars). Laptop heats very little during gamming. Finally, I am happy to purchased this laptop.",5
They say it's Gaming Laptop but to actually play games on it with a decent FPS (60-70) you have upgrade ram as well as install SSD!,5
"its a awesome laptop, only draw back is the battery, but that too is that bad, it does'nt heat up or anything, but if you play high graphical powered games like GTA 5, WATCHDOGS, etc, it last about only an hour in battery settings high performance. it does'nt lag or shuts down randomly. if you are looking for a reliable laptop with good graphics and high performance gaming. perfect laptop for you.",5
Nice laptop I recommend to buy,5

"Seems to working fine for now, and I've been using it for over a month. The display is just mesmerizing.  Even though you expect the gaming laptop to have good speed, you can't just pile up tasks on it and expect it to run smooth.  Also, a lot of people are complaining about the battery, which is absolutely ridiculous. The high grade cpu and GPU obviously take more energy than your regular potato pc. Also, if you run a heavy app, the laptop is bound to lose energy quickly.  Overall, a good pu...",5

Its a beast at this price. Go for it. I played GTA 5 and it ran smoothly but obviously not on ultra high graphics. It's good for everything mainly gaming. But you should upgrade your ram to 16gb for maximum performance.,5

"I purchased my MacBook air from Flipkart at a great festive discount. This was the most inexpensive option available in the market at any of the shopping sites. I must say that I am completely satisfied with this purchase. The quality of laptop and the performance of the machine is brilliant. The best advise that I can give to anybody willing to purchase a laptop is to invest a little more and go for the best. MacBook Air is one of the best machines From the perspective of quality, display, w...",5

"Thi product is awesome. Was a bit sad about the delivery because it took 24 hours more than expected delivery but Flipkart immediately added a gift card saying sorry which was cute. DELIVERY IS ALWAYS FAST for these products. Mine might have been an exception. Coming to laptop, Macbook is an all new experience. The laptop meets your expectations. For those switching from Windows do go through a Mac tutorials as there are a lot of hidden features which you want to unveil. PROS: Awesome battery...",5
"It's superb for entertainment, watching movies & battery performances is so good I am very happy with that.One major problem is that for official work or for the Ph.D scholars I would think it's not good as most of the windows applications are not supported in mac Os system so it would be difficult to run app like Origin,Chemdraw,Peakfit apps (which are not available in apple store excepy chemdraw although you need to pay for this monthly).",5
"very good performance and nice design of this laptop. It's quite better then windows laptop of this price range speed and processing is fast but display colours are not vibrant but its not that bad too its good for normal works. Internal SSD storage is too less its a major issue with this MacBook, one can bought the 256gb variant but its cost is high and size is also smaller. I am using this from one month and its performance is very impressive and also apple services is top class. One issue...",5
Works like a Magic. I had doubts before buying ..after a week of using this product I'm totally satisfied with the product. Thanks to seller also for providing the genuine product.,5
This is my first review in Flipkart. My wife gifted me this MacBook air on anniversary. I was worried about the online purchase and authenticity. But I would like to assure you that I have received 100 percent original product. I have checked the serial number online. The packaging was perfect. I have received the laptop on 23.01.2020. till now it's well and good. Battery is awesome I am getting at least 10 hours in a single charge. My usage are mainly official and YouTube video watching. Ve...,5
"Well it's Apple, so you can't really go wrong with it. Battery definitely lasts for 10 hours. If you're a Windows user, Mac Os will take some getting used to. No Microsoft office, so that's always a downer. But all in all a great laptop. Can't stress how compact and travel friendly it is! Definitely worth the kidney I sold for this haha",5
"Simply The Best Laptop If U can Get It Under 50K. Most recommended for Law students and frequent travelers amazing speakers amazing speed the display doesn't feel bad if u. are upgrading from 30-40 k laptop but if u are coming down from higher specced PC or Laptop then only u can find the difference because of the smaller screen, the PPI is great so every content looks great I got it for 42K at Big.

"I didn't know if I could leave my windows PC behind and switch to a Mac, but when I saw the deal thats was offered on the big sale, I took a leap of faith. Got this product at 45k, and having chosen the 'No cost EMI' that was available, it was an effortless purchase. One that I'm really glad of. The build quality is excellent, nothing that is offered by the counterparts running windows at this price. The OS is very beautiful, you can easily fall in love with it. And I can't say anything that ...",5
"Received the laptop in neat packaging which was delivered 2 days prior to the due date. The MacBook Air is lightweight, has great battery performance, HD display, backlit keyboard and sleek finish.  Really happy with the purchase, thank you Flipkart!",5
"it's obvious why apple products are so expensive, they work on following principles - 1. best quality in ergonomics 2. best quality in design 3.best quality in performance been over 6 months using macbook air, never have been so happy with a laptop before. got this at around 59k, updated to MacOS Mojave which is very powerful.",5

"I was confused between this and MacBook pro. If you ain‚Äôt going to use it as a professional 4k video/photo editor or a hard core gamer go for MacBook Pro.  If you does light editing ( 1080p or less) for your YouTube channel and normal photoshop editing your photos, this machine works perfectly fine. Go for it without any doubt.  Pros: - Very Light weight - Great Performance - Cheapest Macbook available - SSD drive - Has MacOS (Virus free OS) - Great Apple ecosystem if you use iPhone and...",5
I love this beautiful machine very powerful and perfect choice for iOS developer. Highly recommended for start development for iOS application.,5

"I bought this one for stability. This one is sleek, like super sleek and sexy. Although I miss the numeric keyboard but the stability, battery and performance makes up for it. And for those concerned about quality of screen, I will say it is far better than what reviewers here say. I mean I have worked on 15k laptop, a FHD laptop (my last one) and many others one. Even though pixel wise the display is a tad lower than FHD screen but nowhere bad like those windows HD screen. I love it. Other t...",5

"First time Mac users please read this. Best at this Price Point, even if it is increased from 55000 to 65000 within an year but still good. Yes when you are setting up your Mac please press on the trackpad because if you just click then it will not work you can change that to touch after setting up your Mac after going to settings.

"I have used all company laptops, dell, Sony vaio, hp, Lenovo etc . This is the best. Great quality and smooth buttery performance. Don‚Äôt go by the specs. Apple always integrates software and hardware better than other company in the world.  Con: the operating system needs some time to get adjusted to. But once you learn it - you will be enjoying a fantastic experience.",5
The Product Is Awesome And As I Expected Its Worth.I loved It Awesome Performance And I M An Mechanical Engineer It Perfectly Fitted For My Designing Softwares . I Rated 4 Because Delivery Is Not Good .,5
"I was using windows based laptops for many years now...things were okay till the time i bought ASUS laptop E203NAH in 2018 which made my life miserable and thats how i thought of moving out of windows based laptops.

"Before buying Macbook, first anaylse your requiremnets. If you want a descent laptop with highest battery backup and which can be easily portable and you don't want it for gaming purpose. Then I must recommend you for the Macbook Air. The 2017 model which I have purchased performs well even when many apps are simultaneously open. Also if you are switching from windows to mac, then you will see the vast differences and you will love it. In short its a perfect laptop for general task such as do...",5

thak you apple for such wonderful product with such satisfying price and excellent performance. thanks to flipkart too for too good services. worth buying.,5
Wow the best laptop I have ever used!! It is an excellent piece of work done by apple. Mac os is simply the best os in the world. Once a Mac user always a Mac user.,5

It has 128 GB of solid state ssd and 8 GB of ram. processor is it dual core 1.8 ghz. Body made of aluminium unibody. Keyboard is fine but unlike macbook pro, keys are made of polymer.

Great Product. Delivered in proper packing and Delivery boy was very supportive and helpful,5
Amazing product. Worth buying. With this price you will get high end specs with windows os but the stability of Mac os is 1000 tines way better than windows. Integration of external peripherals are ultimate. Watch videos if you are first time user.,5

Nicely packed and delivered by special delivery process by Flipkart.Purchased on 3 Sept and got delivered on 4 sept, Great delivery process by Flipkart.",5
"very good product (light weight, high battery back up, reliable mac os, fast speed due to SSD and 8GB RAM, and doesn't heat up when used for long, and going by history of the product it should sustain all these good points even after years, unlike other laptops that deteriorate after few months or couple of years) and then unbeatable price as I bought it at final price of 48.5k",5

These are the honest reviews from me , This light weight beauty c...",5
Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.,5
"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w...",5
Apple..The name is enough to describe it's experience. it's awesome ... Very slim and smooth surface. just in love with it.,5
"Firstly Delivery was superfast. Product was properly packed And sealed. Its an apple product, you buy it because u are used to premium and hassle free interface. I previously had a macbook pro 2012 model was quite satisfied with it. But it had hdd drive, so the processing got little slow over time and it couldn‚Äôt keep up with the regular software updates and it started lagging. So i decided to with the air, because the price point was good and the new generation air are really nice but are a ...",5
I purchased this laptop on march 14th 2020 and I have been coding in this since then only and it is awesome laptop and it doeanot lags as the windows laptops and it is runming smoothly even after so much of huge code and also i am using photoshop and it is working fine.Design is awesome and I like the keyboard and the glass touchpad of apple and it is simply marvellous.,5
"very elegant. very satisfied. its the best amongst all. super fast operations, bright hd display, awesome sound quality and lightning fast processing. loved it.",5
Mac OS is smooth and easy to use.... absolutely best buy for 2019 too....go for it with out a second thought.... don't get into too much research on screen pixel etc etc....for a normal user it's THE BEST laptop....not for gamers for sure....,5
Beautiful Machine with great speed and nice battery back up ! Absolutely no hang ..nothing .Finally it's apple !! One drawback what I would like to mention is storage ..it would have been 256Gb . Rest is absolutely fine . Recommend to buy it !,5
"Due to 1.8 GHz processor speed little slow other wise excelent product. really apple is a best brand, I purchased it Rs. 52K in big billian sale 2018. it's good looking, light weight,with good battary backup.",5
"Ultimate Product and Complete Peace of Mind !!  I bought Mac Book Air 6 months ago during great India shopping day, stunning slim look and lowest weight. Best part is longest battery back up of 8-9 hrs.",5
"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ...",5
One of the finest product I have ever used in my life. Apple had really done very good job by manufacturing such a product within reach of a middle family income. Commendable job.,5
"It is perfect in all ways if anybody want any laptop. Then it is the best because it, itself inspire us to work",5
"Good and fast ,only limitation is 128 gb storage,upgraded from Catalina to BIG SUR ,many good features like my iPhone and iPad mini get connected so that I can pickup phone from laptop MacBook Air itself and no need to enter passwords etc provided u have same Apple ID ,compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint which I purchased separately",5
"It is my first time when i was working on Macintosh and i am really impressed. It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it .",5
"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase. Thank you Flipkart and Seller",5

"Received duplicate straps (Belt) within 6 to 8 month both belts cut down automatically..... Watch is good, belt cost is 3k....",2
Don't ever buy fitbit watch'. If anything happens after one year they will say that as it is out of warranty so nothing can be done. You may buy if you can invest such a huge amount for one year. My watch is not getting connected with any mobile phone means i thing bluetooth is not working. Its better to buy some other watch which is not so costly. On help they says nothing can be done as it is not getting connected.,2
I can not fix silicone black strap to the dail. Their is no notifications on watch and i am facing problems because of this,2
Don't buy this product none of the feature is not working in this product and waste of money,2

Money waste,2
"Product is good. Asthetics are to my taste. Pedometer isn't accurate. If you're traveling in a bus, it will calculate steps due to sheer vibrations. Battery life is good if you are not using notifications or connected GPS.  Now the worst part - Fitbit doesn't have a single service center any where in the world. So if you damage this watch, you will have to buy a new one. Period.",2
"belt looks decent, but does not fit with the watch pins. You won't be able to use it.",2
While calculating floors and exercise duration. It's highly inaccurate !!! So accuracy which is the main thing is major issue. Battery backup is good which is 3+ days.  Stopped working in 4 months only. And fitbit take a very very long time to replace your watch.,2

"Using it for quite some time. Fellow buyers, please don't get too much impressed with all these positive reviews. Even if price drops to 20000 during sale, its not worth it. Image quality is just like a smartphone. LCD screen has very very few pixels, so you can't use it in live view mode and also can't actually analyse picture you have just clicked. Autofocus is generally slow in live view mode in most of dslr but in this camera, it is very very slow. Image has too much noise in indoor shot...",2

Pros: 1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot  Cons: 1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time 2. Makes lot of noise while printing.  Verdict: You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...,2
This printer is good also it can be used to copy but this is not good for scanning. scanning option is seen anywhere. printing and coping is clear and good. good for homely use.,2
"Product quality is good. But the Ink cartridge is small with the printer in two numbers (ie. Colour & black) Refill cartridge cost above Rs.800/-. Flipkart delivery boy insisted the ""home"" delivery in our area, we given the delivery address clearly at the time of booking with Pincode. After few argument, finally they delivered ""on the road"" nearer to the address given. I am not happy with the delivery, that is why 2 star rating given.",2
"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy. Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day.",2
Best t Best Buy on Flipkart nice to print absolutely fine,2

Consumption of ink is too high .only 43 pages printed with black ink.,2
"Guys, buy this only if your usage is once in a while. cartridges are very tiny and they are very expensive. You have to buy cartridges quite often.  Am really disappointed with my purchase",2
Printer cost is less but later printer mentioning is very petetic. It's replace empty ink cartridges both colour and and black is more than printer cost . So please think before buy inkjet printers. It's useless.,2

"U'll need some upgrades  Ram needs to be extended, out of 8 gb some ram is always dedicated as shared memory for GPU, that is vega 8 (Not the main dedicated gpu).  Better to upgrade with a sdd at least for the os drive.  Not a beast for gaming but if upgraded can provide decent gaming experience. Don't expect good gaming or intense gpu performance on battery at this budget. Batteries for gaming laptop are not ment to provide you backup for long.  Got it at 44k, I think can't buy any thing bet...",3
"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues.",3
"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage.",3

It was damn slow and plastic felt very cheap, like for example, when you lift the laptop, you hear cracking noise throughout.  2 laptop;  First thing I did to uninstall the trail version antivirus as that made the laptop too slow. Second, updated windows and drivers.  Performance is ok and I'm not rating good because, the load time is very high but once wha...",3
At first week the laptop was quite fast it's booting time was also less than 1 min. But after 1 month due to some windows 10 update booting tome went upto 4-5 minutes. And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one. I could suggest you that instead of buying HDD you may buy 4gb 1050 graphic card with SSD. Whi...,3
I have been using this product for the last 10 days. So let me share my experience here.  -Its packing was great  -It has a decent screen.  -The backlight keyboard with violet color makes it quite attractive.  -speaker sound is good  -Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...,3
The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...,3
Best Value And Discount From Flipkart.... But This Hp pavilion Ryzen 5 Gaming Laptop Not Good For Gaming Performance.... Please add some money and get better Version Of Ryzen And Graphics Cards.... Like GEOFORCE RTX,3
Satisfactory.,3
1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!,3
Good product but delay in delivery,3
"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance.",3
"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed. Positive points:  Display is value for the money. Design is great, body looks awesome. After effects and GTA V runs like charms.  I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure...",3
"It‚Äôs like ok ok type laptop, it does lag at times even not playing games or using editing softwares , I m planning to upgrade the ram and add ssd for faster results. Display and Battery performance is good",3
Its bad some error issues plz say any suggestions about my problem,3
It's take to much time to start and shut down it's with out SSD so windows is so slow,3
Just for normal works.....old rated product,3
"I donnow it takes 2.1 minutes to start only some times, i feel somehere d system is slow, may be bcz of No SSD, but still this shouldn't be this much slow, even opening photos, opening windows takes around 10 seconds some times even 15 seconds, and multi task also i feel not too fast, lets see after two days hw it works Even the Adobe softwares response is also satisfactory, not completely satisfied",3
It was good but sometimes apps like blender and fusion 360 are not responding I don't know exactly what the problem is but I downloaded the apps with lisence but why the are not responding nad battery backup is not up to the mark I think it should be get more backup and charging speed is okay..,3
Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.,3
Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage,3
Awesome product.,3
Not bad,3
A bit slow but it's good ..,3
If you are really into gaming and want to buy a high performance laptop do not buy it. Never ever go for Ryzen. I won't suggest you ever. I am writing this honest review after using it for a month. Do not buy it.,3
Just need to add sdd and ram then it wll be beast,3
IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...,3
No bad but ok,3
If u r buying the hdd version upgrade as fast as u can to ssd,3
Little slow it's giving me reminder of first generation pc black and white once,3

Booting time is high.. I recommend to add an SSD and move windows to it. Otherwise nice laptop for entry level gaming and editing...,3
Battery life is too bad,3
This is a good product In terms of value for money. But I face a problem which is Slow boot. I write this review after 4 month Continue use. Go for it But Mind it Insert a Ssd for batter experience,3
Am graphic designer. After using 1 month of photoshop. Lot of hang issues. So any one buy for designing purpose. Go for Ssd version. Not this. But apart from designing. It's really good.. üòá‚úåÔ∏è. Im telling only for designing people's. Not everyone.,3

Boot time is slow,3
No ssd so poor performance boot time 30 sec,3
"It is a very good laptop. I am writing this review after one week of delivery. I used this laptop and found some cons. The battery life is very low and the 8 GB ram, we provided by 5.8 GB on which we used and the other 2.2 GB is locked for hardware. Due to lack of ssd this laptop is slow working and boot time about 25-35 sec.  But overall this laptop is great.",3
Good,3
Performance is slow,3
Best on this price range,3
Bro the speed is really very slow like its hangs for like 30sec after i close a game and booting time is 1min 10secs .... If anyone can fix this please let me know coz i had put all my 3 year savings on this laptop,3
Battery backup not so good. Games very slow,3
Go for ssd varient It lacks even in bluestacks,3
"I'm writing this after using it for 3 months.  Considering the configuration it has, the laptop is extremely slow. It takes nearly 3 mins just to switch on. App loading is very slow. While playing game as well, game stutters (FIFA 19). So, performance wise, not at all good.  Looks is great. Keyboard backlight looks attractive, however you can't keep backlight on all the time as it consumes reasonable battery as well. If you keep the backlight off, since the keyboard letters are written in pu...",3

Heating and lag issue...,3

This laptop is very good but other 0battery is very bad for me only one hour play game I am suggest a pc for gaming but this is good,3
"Everything was okay except the performance is slow due to HDD, better to go for SDD version",3
Battery is is week and speed is also slow recommend ssd drive,3
I can play free fire with lag,3
Decent product,3
U can fell the lag and don't even dare to install BlueStacks.It'll hang,3
Not satisfied with the performance speed...,3
Little bit slow in start otherwise if works smooth And you should upgrade to ssd then it gives good performance,3
Product ok but we need to upgrade to ssd,3
Dont expect too much,3
While running editing softwares for coding or some other big softwares...it slows down coz of the 6gb ram(+2gb internal graphics)...ram upgrade and ssd upgrade can help sort this issue....otherwise 5 out 5 on value for money.,3
If thay have added even a 128Gb SSD means it's an amazing deal..,3
"At my first time usage till now os running very slow and lagging and hanging issues too much of heating issue is also, very disappointed",3
"Go for it, but need to extend ssd and ram for better game experience",3
This ia very good product but battery backup is very low otherwise very good.,3

I TS LAGGING bro,3
"Booting is too slow , getting heat even in low end games because of the and processer you will get to use only 6 gb of ram",3
U need to upgrade it by adding more ram and adding and ssd without this lags a lot very slow pc,3
The product is awesome but the delivery boy is very worst in behaviour.,3
ssd version is much better than hdd and charging speed is very very slow else the very good product,3
"The design,look is absolutely good..",3
"1. First thing which matters is it's built quality. The plastic hp uses in front side of laptop is very pure,you can easily press it and if you give some little pressure on it it can be borke. you can't think that it's a laptop's plastic. Many toys have better plastic than it. It is not a long lasting laptop as the outer surface is weak. Easily fingertips shows anywhere of laptop. Touchpad is also not out of mark.  2. The performance is not so good. All is right if you add a ssd and ram. I...",3

Not Bad,3
Processing is very slow Compared with old i3 hdd system . Always go with SSD.,3
Good at this range,3
Good product at this price,3
Soo good,3
"VERY DISAPPOINTED Given the specs it should work like high end device but disappointed me a lot, it takes time to open any kind of application and if we install any sort of game then device starts hanging.",3
"Without ssd as its boot drive it feels very slow when starting, and sometimes feels like lagging when tried to run few applications at once.",3
"Slow processor ,only 5.9gb ram available.",3
HDD is littile slow it takes more time than expected to boot Display is üëå Recomend adding SSD or SSD varient,3

Cyberpunk lagging even after running on low settings Assassin's creed black flag runs at high settings Laptop automatically shut down while playing game at high setting(after 15 mins) Only problem with ram. As 6 gb is usable. Need to upgrade.,3
Battery not good...only works 3 hrs,3
Battery in high performance is only 30 to 50 minute,3
Don't buy ryzen take intel,3
Battery backup is very worst,3
"Average one , battery drain is too fast, much lags we will face even while normal use also.",3
Lagging not satisfied with the product,3
This laptop hangs. Like seriously after this much of processors and RAMs. Should have gone for SSD one thats beast.,3
Overall Nice but it will hang when you will run multiple software and chrome,3
Laptop isn't that great until it has an ssd in it because without ssd it's just frustrating to use this lap Otherwise for gaming it's a beast and for multitasking too Go for this one if u have a budget below 50k,3
Not too much satisfied from the performance. But yeah this is the good laptop for mid range gaming and office users.,3
Good,3
Buy asus better then this,3
Upgrade to ssd. Boot up is pretty slow as well as opening softwares. But a RAM too if you want a lili but of additional performance,3
"Gud laptop in this price range! Gave 3star becouse HD version is so slow, go for an SSD version or add an SSD to it.",3
Overall decent laptop. Loud fans. Bootup time is slow for a new laptop. No heating issue so far. Above average for gaming and general use.,3
The laptop is on bit slower side... Go for SSD ...rather then HDD ... Else everything is manageable...  I played fifa 2019 and it lagged,3
"After using 1 month I am writing this review. Look wise it's fine 4.5+. And performance is bit OK not that much. It's 4 out of 5. I thought Ryzen could be faster then intel but my previous i3 n i5 lenono, HP and dell they are fine. Not much but little bit compare to this.

"It's an okayish laptop. But u won't find any other laptops offering the specs which this lap is offering in the price range. It takes approx 30-90- sec to start and all the apps open very slow. Moreover, only 5.88 GB ram can be used out of the 8GB as 2GB ram is reserved for igpu this makes the games to lag a bit and they cant be run in max settings. I am personally a bit disappointed but I can't blame HP as they have tried to give a gaming lap in the extreme budget range. But the best remedy ...",3

The product is good you can play Valorant at 150-200 fps in medium settings and play many other games I haven't tried GTA 5 yet as it takes a hell lot of time to download The only reason I gave it a 3 star rating is because of the exchange reason. They told they will give me 11k discount but when they came they told a reason which isn't mentioned in the check list but still they told us to pay 7k more so I could only get discount for 4k Everything was good the laptop was fast it had good spec...,3
"I bought this laptop about a month ago.The design looks super cool and gaming too was very good.I have played COD Ghost,GTA 5 etc. and the perfomance was good(there is some lag now and then).But there are some serious perfomance issues i must point out. --It takes a good amount of time to start the lap. --the desktop lags very badly and it really tests our patience. -- while browsing this lap makes me think that those who built it never thought of any other use than gaming.Its really that bad...",3

I am not able to change the resolution of the screen for games,3
"very less storage,poor display and no useful free app available in Apple store. most important MS office for Mac book very costly",3
actually the product was good but I have the concerned about the battery battery is not like what they have describe it like 12 hours of full day work battery life but I guess there is like you can use for 4 hours continuously but no after that you need to connect the charger otherwise is good but battery is not good,3
"I got a faulty product. The delivery was fantastic. Packaging was perfect and the experience of a mac was superb. However, the usb ports do not work for me which is a disappointment. I will now need to carry it to a service centre or apple store and get it replaced. I noticed it a couple days later since I didn‚Äôt try usb. So, this makes my experience a little bitter. Nevertheless good job with the delivery flipkart. Appreciate",3

if you are really serious about display quality then it is quite disappointed for me when i first open and expected a good display .. if you have budget go for retina display,3
Screen quality is not upto the mark. Other features are really good..,3

But let me tell you after purchasing a laptop worth 60k you don't want to repair it again at a cost of at least 40k. Coming to design and performance both are awesome. But if y...",3

Battery backup not more than 3hr,3
Its a decent product...go for it only if u have a budget constraint....cant be used for full day use the system gets little heated up on full day usage. The delivery takes a long time ...it took almost a month for me. After many many customer calls.,3
Warranty problems,3
Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good,3
"bought it for 54k on BBDays, sad is that just minutes before it was of 49k. Design is Nice Battery is nice Display is Bad sound is ok performance is nice. (it's my second mac, hence reviewing it)",3
Thank u.! Flipkart Got for 44k best one Delivery on time.,3
Great,3
Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube,3
"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd.",3
"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened",3
"Very nice performance according to my usage. I mainly use for attending classes,projects, documents and research purposes. Don't even think before buying it! Just Buy it. It's amazing",3
ROM is less due to which it run slow.,3
Display viewing angle is very bad. 10 Hours battery backup is not true. Only 6-7 hour battery backup. I'm using only browser & documents work.  Apart from this.. Good laptop for day to day usage.  THE BEST mouse trackpad. Great keyboard.,3
Slow screen boost had scratches,3
One of the keys not working,3
"I received September 2020 MFG product @59990/-. Build quality good. Apple logo in the back side is glowing. 2 usb 3.0, 1 thunderbolt port v2, 1 micro sdxc slot and charger port.

As per My recommend don't buy please go to windows.",3
I donno why my product is not getting validated on apple coverage site any one else facing the same problm? Btw i liked the macbook air but validation problm,3
"Product is good bt , Flipkart took too much time to deliver it ,üò°üò°",3
This apple macbook air nice in design. One cons is heating issue in bottom. During charging i was seeing online movie then bottom of laptop & charger is being more heated than as usual. This must not happen with premium company's laptop.,3
Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.,3
"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!",3
Nice,3
"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this.",3

"I got it for 57,990/- well many got it as low as 54,990/- , I missed it though . This is an unbelievable price in which it is available in Flipkart .  Macbooks are always good .  But the reason I am giving 3 stars is the battery backup is not good . MacBook Air has an incredible battery backup 10-12 hrs. Unfortunately I GOT it for only 1 week . AFter that its 3-4 hrs max .",3
ok,3
I haven't get the hard copy of the invoice and warranty card. otherwise the product is good.,3
Product is good but filipkart delivery was so delayed it took 10 days to deliver the product,3
The only reason for 3 star is for the exchange. Pls don't use flipkart exchange they expect a new laptop for exchange. The executive who came for exchange doesn't even know how to check processor generation of my computer. Even there is no dent he is trying to convinced that there is a dent.,3

"Writing this review after full 24 hours of putting this machine to grind. I bought this with a certain kind of apprehension, wondering the budget I had, the choice made after thorough research and the product chosen would cater to my needs or not?

This is the best budget laptop.. I bought it for 18990 on a sale. Good laptop But performance is not as expected.,3
Nice but for light use only,3
Its really slow machine and took minutes to boot. I have updated window as well but speed is really slow. Actually dualcore works only with xp not for window 10. Better if you can few more thousands and buy I3 or i5,3
Best at this price,3
The laptop is best in very cheap price,3
"Overall I would grade it 3/5. Display colours are very dim may be because of anti glaze screen. Storage is pitiable.... even my 7 years old Lenovo has got better storage than it.

However, If Asus can reduce the size which will look attractive, whole plastics is been used instead if they could have used metal, that would be essential.

"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo...",3
"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work",3
First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...,3
first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance,3
"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student.",3
Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...,3
Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.,3
"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)...",3
"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product.",3
laptop is okk in this price range .....bt i faced issues with display ...camera...bluetooth drivers.....lenovo website is also not providing any proper solution regarding driver installation......rest of things r okkk......flipkart delivery is grt as usual......bt overall .. I'm personally not satisfied with this product.,3
The main think is battery.. which is not up to mark,3
good product at this price range but i am sick of hearing fan voice in this,3
antivirus show for one year but given only 1 month .,3
Battery backup is low. Sound is not good. Performance is OK,3
Ok.,3
"This is a nice budget laptop and looks premium.. But the problem is the battery, if you will upgrade it with better SSD and ram it will give you decent performance. it supports m.2 nvme...",3
"Display sucks, poor viewing angles, backlight burns through the panel  Battery life is under 4 hours  Otherwise great, Disable antivirus and update windows for faster experience, ram upgrade recommend",3
The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.,3
Average laptop. Don't expect it to be decent quick. Opens up applications after more than 30 secs. Would not recommend it for heavy or moderate use.,3
"Ifter 5 days of use .... Taking time to boot up , performance is ok ok , rest all good ....",3
Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.,3
It is good but it is slow,3
Little bit slower but value for money,3

Average performance. Poor battery charge. Good laptop for light work.,3
It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives.. Battery backup is less Display is good It lags in between We have to increase the RAM for better performance No slot for LAN cable No USB slot in right of the laptop.. slots are in left side Cursor button pad is bit stiff.,3
Ok product,3
"Quite slow pc. Display is bad. Laptop material is cheap. Webcam is pathetic. Boot time is unbearable.. Will have to update the ram to make it usable for day to day task.. I regret buying this laptop... If anyone reading feedback, dont buy this laptop. Check for other budget laptops.",3
Ok,3
"Design is good , battery life also not bad approx 4 hours or max (on normal working ) , performance is not really speed but in this range good",3
Ok,3
Working for normal use...sound is not at level. For personal use it's good.,3
value for money,3
It hangs a most while..better to get upgraded ram to 8 g or 12 gb then there could be some hike in performance..,3
I hate it. Its performance is very slow. It takes too much time open Ms excel. Now think about about the other applications. Think before you purchase this laptop.,3
Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.,3
Picture clarity is less. Speed is not good. Always hanging. Not satisfied,3
"This laptop are very stylish look,and possessor are also good",3
As axpected sound otherwise good,3
Everything is good but battery backup is very poor,3
"If you're looking for anything more than casual browsing and playing videos, skip this one.",3

Go to more ram 4 gb ram is not much better..go to more ram such as 8 gb or 12 gb ram...I upgraded to 12 gb..... now performance is better........,3

Very slow performance,3
"You should add 8gb ram,or else its waste,it not 8gb ram i will compare it to pentium processor",3
"Very slow device. Even if you want to use it for educational purposes, jts not useful as it runs very slow. Now i need to spend extra to upgrade it with SSD memory or RAM",3
Better to buy laptop with 8 gb ram. Display is good. Performance slow with 4 gb ram.,3
Very slow,3
Cheap and best. Home and Student purpose ok.,3
It's getting fan sound heavy,3
"This is a entry level budget laptop and even has a good performance due to the AMD processor, gaming might be twitchy while playing mediocre game but handles every day daily task easily but might be a bit slow while multitasking, overall it is not 5 star but a manageable lap for students and entry level laptop learners I would say",3
Starting it was okay but as days passed its geeting slow. After opening application its doing good. But it lags while opening the application,3
It is a 'kaam chalau' laptop. Bought it for my Dad. The only thing he doesn't like about it is its trackpad which feels weird and too plasticy so we use a external mouse.,3
Battery down fast..And you can't see the screen cross directions...Only straight you can watch on this.. As per this drawbacks price is very high.dont buy.,3
Dear team no body help me for system installation please help me,3
Not that great. Expected better performance from the specifications of the laptop.,3

The product specs are really good. I had more expectations from the build quality but it is not,3
"Not so great overall but decent for the price i got.  Preformance is just ok you need need atlest 8gb ram and ssd for better performance.  Battery life is mediocre.  Display is full HD although not so bright and viewing angle is poor.  Few keyboard in button didn't work at start got some solution online, but ut keep happening after windows update.",3
Not having CD disc drive. I am surprised that laptop is not having disc drive. Hanged once with in week,3
One thing is annoying in this laptop is its fan noise.,3

Speaker volume is very low as of my openion rest the laptop is good for basic uses....,3
"Over all ok, display quality is not good, performance is not bad.",3
This is no better than editing,3
"Non of the windows drives were up to date, had to upgrade everything and until it was upgarded, MS office wont get installed.  Lags a lot, better to get the RAM upgraded. Not for gamers or heavy users",3
Ok Ok at this Price,3
"Battery life less than 3 hours. Display isnt upto the mark. Lenevo 30gb promotion with Dropbox offer doesnt work. Better to upgrade RAM as onboard 4 gb will not help in even basic tasks, will always lag. Not for heavy use. Ok for basic programming and studies.",3
Not bad at all,3
"The performance of this laptop SUCKS, really , truly sucks.  Dont buy this laptop for any more than 25k, so you can afford a ram upgrade & probably a ssd.  The display is above average. The battery is poor. The look is great.  Performance is worse than a pentium laptop.",3
Performance abit slow,3

Using for around 2 months now. Sometimes it freezes while in online classes.",3
The Camera quality is too bad & the sound of the speaker is too low to listen. Didn't expect this type of quality from LENOVO. Do anyone has the way how to over this issue?  Picture quality is good.,3
Very slow. We Need to upgrade Ram for better performance.,3
"Customer support very poor... If someone willing to buy, then put the money in some other use or buy it form nearly shop.. but do not take such product from flipkart.. My money totally lost.. And also lenovo support very poor and disappointing..",3
"Ordered it and received ontime. Firstly very bad camera, those who use for online meeting, full grains u can see. Battery drains fast 2hrs max u can use. First 10 days return period it was silent but after that fan started making noise too much don't know any solution to it. Overall average to little above average performance for this price range.",3
Good for online classes only ..if u try to open multiple tabs it just slows down..web cam and speaker quality really bad..,3
Sound speaker very worst pls design speaker in top of the laptop dont put sound speaker on down audio level very very low,3
Fan makes continuous noise which is irritating. Rest is just like any other laptop in this price range.,3
I just think it's an average performing laptop. Maybe that's what you get for this price . ONE TIP use it on the LAP or a STAND if keep it on bed and use it for long it will over heat and start crashing until gets cool,3
"Display is dull lighting, camera is poor quality, bit slow",3

Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge...",3
"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price.",3
I am completely disappointed after taking this phone. Price is bit high compare to other barand available in the market.. Other budget phone give phone rocrd option but mi didn't give even record option in this phone... Very mu disappointed. And performance wise phone is very laggy .

Overall the phone is good I am just writing my review after a week of usage ..  1. Camera is too good in this price segment 2. Display is little bit dull in day time when you go out in sunlight even though the brightness is full nothing is clear on screen. 3. Battery backup is outstanding. 4. Stereo speaker is clear and good.  Disadvantages  Lack of speed for 4 GB ram Mobile is getting warm even for minimal usage.,3

Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.,3
Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.,3
"Camera is goodüëçüèª not osmüòÆ , battery is poor according 5000mah‚òπ , display is osmm ü§©and selfie üëåüèª, stock android is osmmü§©. Bright ness is little bit .

"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto.",3
"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be...",3
"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger.",3

"Battery drains quickly being a 5000MAH it has to have atleast 24 hours of battery life but it gets drained everyday and you have to charge it for every 12 hours, Camera is good, Display is average, Heating issue when browsing (Facebook, WhatsApp or other social networking apps) & YouTube etc. It comes with a 20 Watts fast charger for a name sake only. You cannot apply a theme to it but you customize apps appearance, apply colors & various text formats or styles. This is one of the average pho...",3

"Let me list out all the pros and cons of this Moto G30. Pros: -Stock Android -Overall Build and Quality - -Price (11k) -USB C Charging -Display 90 hz, you can watch videos more smoothly and more frames per second.

"Disappointed with the product. 64mp camera is not upto the mark. Image quality is not good. 13 mp primary camera is also not good. 5000mah battery takes much time to charge full. But drains too fast. Phone Lags frequently ... Dissatisfaction. Waste of money. Please try some other products like mi , realme etc in this range.",3
Super performance this mobile,3
This mobile is for average users. Don't load lots of app,3
Pros: Good Form Factor Good display Clean UI  Cons: Bit bulky Poor Camera performance,3
all is good in phone for the price can used for 2 to 3 year long after ( it isreveiw after used 1 month),3
Over all depend on your choice. But little bit slow procesor in this mobile.,3
"The phone is good , but camera and display is average but this price range good products And build quality is good...",3
"In hand feel, design, near stock android experience all are good. Camera quality could be better. Rated 3 star because I expected better camera. I like Motorola in providing near stock android experience. Thanks for keeping that while most of the brands comes with lots of junk apps. I personally like moto action, and display features. Really useful. Charger is just okay. Except camera and charger It's a good choice. I will write detailed review later",3

Okay okay products I suggest you don't buy for that,3
I Bought this device on 3rd March.. but started facing connectivity issues from first day. On the carrier end it's showing the device is not 4g compatible..

Overall Display is very good. 4/5 Camera is very good.4/5 Battery is good but despite 20W fast charge it takes longer than it should.3.5/5 Speaker is loud and good 4/5 90Hz refresh rate 5/5 B...,3
Only the drawback is that it has a hybrid sim lot and it doesn't have gallery all the images n videos are saved in Google drive itself,3

"Camera face sensor very worst performance, software performance good, camera focus mode very bad, camera day time good, Camera night time very bad, Gorilla glass isn‚Äôt not available front side,only Ips display Battery is average Display brightness leval low HD+display only",3
"While the phone is good, the battery is woefully inadequate. The new phone charged to 100% doesn't even last for a day, that too without much use. Phone is bit heavy, but manageable. Stock Android is an advantage over other budget phones.",3
"Camera struggles a lot to focus on text of a document. Really bad and unexpected. 1 good thing I noted, it blurs background of a object in clicks, throws some extra focus & depth that enhances the object view. Check in pic. Battery could have been better, screen felt average or ok. Display is again just ok",3
"Battery doesn't last even for a day with moderate use. I don't use this done for gaming or streaming, moderate number of calls and microsoft teams for official purposes still the battery hardly last for a day. Low light performance of camera is poor, but gives good results in proper lighting. Camera and youtube crashed multiple times. If u r on a budget go for this, I opted this fone for the price and clean android experience. No unnecessary bloatware. Display is decent. My old one plus 3 ...",3

Good customer service thank you Flipkart but camera quality poor,3
Not perfect product in moto,3
Battery draining very fast. Camera too slow,3
Writing this review after using moto g30 for 10 days. The battery is good. It last almost two days after normal uses. Camera is not good specially the front camera. The phone is little heavy. Just good enough for normal uses not recommended for photography.,3
Camera is not that great. 6gb ram version would have been preferred.,3
"Camera average...Motorola should improve,not just launch products for competition...   Motorola is bigger brand ,hence should focus to give quality not quantity.",3
Good,3
Display is not so good. Rather opt for a fhd display of poco at this price. Performance is no doubt good. But the device has a heating issue when charging. The device and the charger both gets heated up. Value for price of course. But it could have been better.,3
overall good..,3
"Negative: Face lock don't work properly, Unable to answer call most of the time. Not happy üòêüòê  Positive: Beautiful display Battery is really nice Rest all functions are very good ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è",3

Display is very bad....my 4 years old oppo a37's display quality is better than moto g30......,3

Old processor Worst AI Camera Nothing is good in display except refresh rate...,3
"Apart from Camera stability when you zoom, overall the performance looks good. Phone is bit bulky but that should not be a major issue. Felt heating issue when you cast using Google crome. Expected option of 2 SIM with memory card but got dessapointed. Camera looks really worst. Zoom to 4X will kill the stability. If it can be fixed through software update up to some extend, please do the same ASAP.",3

Battery backup is not good....,3
Camera doesn't open sometimes.battary backup is also average.,3

Wifi range is very low MI should hanging too,2
Very bad range,2
Very bad,2
Avarege but length is little bit short....,2
Used this for almost a month. If you are spending 1K to get this. Would recommend to get a DLink for 1.5k. Because this MI router will give you high ping. Low wifi coverage. The connection will break if you are in a different room. In case you have a old build property then the scenerio would get even worse.,2
Despite having 4 antennas range is not satisfactory at all better to go for TP-Link also router dosent connect to my ISP on PPPoE mode despite having correct user ID and password,2
Range is vary low according to 4c,2
Frequent disconnections and slow speed,2
"Not recommended, bcoz not full range in 1rk. Only 3 bar showing near by 10ft distance. And middle 2 antena are dummy not connected to wire.",2
"Not recommended, bcoz not full range in 1rk. Only 3 bar showing near by 10ft distance. And middle 2 antena are dummy not connected to wire.",2
"Not recommended, bcoz not full range in 1rk. Only 3 bar showing near by 10ft distance. And middle 2 antena are dummy not connected to wire.",2
Range not good,2
Nice üëç,2
Nice product useless product. Don't Buy it ..,2
It's working on very less range compare to other routers llike D-Link.,2
It's working on very less range compare to other routers llike D-Link.,2
It's working on very less range compare to other routers llike D-Link.,2
range is not good .. and speed quality is very poor .. and speed is flachuted,2
The range disappointed me,2
The product is extremely difficult to mount. As it can only be placed on a table. Signal strength won't be good enough if you expect signals in one room with the router in another. Don't go for it.,2
üëâüèªThe signal radius is not good as expected üëâüèª It takes more time to turn on  Good but not better,2
after 8 months of usage : with four antennas also they wifi signal is very poor - not even at the distance of 15ft - had to switch back to my older router,2
Not worthy,2
Range is very less,2
Good. But the range is too short compare to another routers.,2
"Range is too bad can't even cover my entire house which is btw not that big and doesn't give expected speed while connected to multiple devices, those four antennas doesn't have much to offer",2
Range is really bad,2
Perfect range & internet speed,2
This router is very bad any people this router not buy,2
Not sure why they have 4 antenna it gives the. Same range a single antenna router over Lan my internet speed is 50 Mbps but WiFi it's 30,2
Range is not at all good..it's showing 300mbps and not getting at least 20 Mbps speed waste of money,2
Covers very low range of area,2
The product is so bad,2
Not as per the mark.,2
Worst... product... connectuvity is not fast... the range of router is Even Worst....,2
Worst range,2
Poor range.,2
The range is not working at all. Even doesn't reach ground floor from first floor.,2
Low range,2
Its a good affordable product but the range of this router is not enough to what i expecting.,2
Very low rang of wifi signals,2
Could not connect to office network due to port forwarding issue and it's not working constant.everytime I had to connect and use port forwarding whenever I connect to office network.,2
Very bad range. Four antenna attracts to purchase at that price. But performance is not even equal to some other two antenna router's. I regret this purchase üòè,2
Poor range Speed is also average. Go for some other options like tenda or D-Link,2
Range of 4 antena is too low as 1antenaüôÑ,2
Network coverage is too bad.,2
Bad natwork,2
Coverage is very bad... those 4 anntenas of no useüëéüèº,2
The range of the WiFi is not at all good. If you want to use it in 2 small rooms nearby then only it's good. Else go for something else.,2
Don't buy this speed and range not good.Buy more trusted brands like Tplink and D-Link.My D-Link router covers almost half of home but this router can't even a single room.,2
Ok ok type route..,2
Very good,2
No call no equipment lat,2
Not good range sometimes disconnect network,2
Worst product,2
It have 4 antenna but my old tplink 2 antenna workd beeter with same range.,2
Did not meet my expectations,2
"Range is not good even having 4 antenna. Also number of lan port is less. Adaptor makes noise like flying house fly in home .. giving two star only for built quality, their no hanging Hooks are there on back side so only you can place it on table top.",2
"Pros: Range is good Cons: it has been just one month and this particular router is showing no internet, where as others are working fine. Though reset is done the same is repeating. Need to get it replaced",2
Bad,2
Wifi penetration is too low and the overall range is poor and has speed variation issues...,2
Ok,2
Very Poor Range Of Signals Connecting issues Waste of 4 antina I will Suggest Netgear,2
Low coverage,2
it doesnt give some much range,2
"range coverage is very disappointing, if you sit near the router it gives good speed, connectivity issues while connected to android TV, disappointed with MI",2
The product is not as good as expected. The speed received on devices is not very fast also.the speed and range decreases when 4 devices are connected,2
Not bad,2
"World's worst router and don't buy it , it has poor routing capacity of signal and speed is goes down after 2 weeks.... Very poor performance",2
not work,2
Nice Product But Speed Problems High Speed Internet Not Support,2
Ok,2
It's not as per my expectation.,2
Don't waste your money on this,2
A good product but every time it rain the router automatically resets so in monsoon it is gonna take a lot of money from you,2
Worst china product.. better buy any locaal brand.. poor and unstable network.,2
Bad range,2
Range issue,2
It's won't connect in my broadband,2
Signal is nt cmng next room of wifi room .. range is very low,2
Network signal week..,2
Week,2
Good but the range for this product is very poor (not expected),2
Signal strength is not too good,2
very low range too bad before i had router with 2 antennas and had way more better range than this one so i bought this to thinking ill get even better range but its range is only half of my old router having 2 antennas. USELESS DONT BUY,2
Not much range i m not satisfied by its range.,2
Disappointed with the range of this router..using for my home purpose...covering only first floor speed is 60 percent decreasing in the ground floor...,2
Bat product,2
Dont have proper range.,2
Product is good but packing of the product is bad,2
Bad Router range it's coverage area maximum 10m,2
"I am happy that it is serving the basic purpose. I have been using it from one week, I haven't disconnected to internet yet, my past router I used to disconnect minimum once in a day, liked it totally. I haven't check for WIPS and MAC filtering, will post soon once I checked that.  Pros: ->Looks are good ->Good range. Serving me for 2 floors with one 3 BHK flat in each floor ->3 lan ports -> Can be easily setup just by seeing the manual not even required to check the CD  Cons: ->Can't be moun...",2
Not giving you good speed Good range but when it about speed it directly caping 50‚ÑÖ speed  Like here if anyone face same problem,2
Product is good but flipcart is very bad..plz avoid flipcart..they can't keep promise ..money seeker,2
"Bad, made in China....",2
The router started not working after an year,2
Go for tp link guys this is not that good,2
"Lot of instability, specially when using as repeater. it disconnects existing connections when new connection is made.",2
When I was both this router I saw that wps button missing and option mod was not working or rang quality very bad.plz I changed this router,2
If we are using WISP Mode it is frequently getting disconnected and sometimes it is unable to Bridge the connection.,2
Very bad,2
Wifi is not stable,2
Not best,2
It's very tough to connect with PC....,2
"The Range is very poor. After 3 month of use, I can see the difference. If you just come outside of ur room, u won't get the wifi. Opt for other..",2
Thw range is not good. Doesn't cover an entire home.,2
Range is very less,2
Avarage,2
Useless. Hardly 10 feet range.,2
WiFi range is very small. Not satisfying product. Just disappointed me,2
It's a single band router with basic features,2
"This 2.4 ghz router basically have speed but main reason due to 2.4 ghz router many times connection interrupts and also 3d gaming is running very roughly if u are a playing pubg, cod etc. If u love all these games then don't buy this product Rest all are good like range speed also other apps like WhatsApp youtube live tv is also done smoothly but gaming is not possible",2
No network connectivity from 1 room to another,2
Bad router wlan light is not working,2
There is a significant drop in the signal strength. A 30mbps connection gives only 5-8mbps throught this router but over 30mbps over Lan cable. The signal strength also drops after 5-8ft making it useless even for a 2bhk.,2
Internet connectivity range not good,2
"Very Slow, and range is less",2
"Writing review after 11 months. The performance has gone Down. Having issue of Range within 1 BHK. Using same ISP with TPLINK router for 2 days trial, now there is no Range issue. Tenda Router N301 is giving issues whereas TP Link routers performance is better in Comparison.",2
Transmission not working.  Flipkart return policy was broken everytime you tried to reach me call gets disconnected and issue was prolonged. Fix thjs ASAP,2
"Not getting speed, Packet loss. Not recommended",2
"Does not work well, slow speeds and short range.",2
"It's an average router, buy tplink or dlink instead",2
Range is very low,2
Waste your Money before not apply broand band connecasation,2
decent product but missing features.,2
Dont buy this its china product.,2
no range,2
low speed net browsing,2
ok,2
"This router has problem, it will be disconnected on every 5 to 10 mins.",2
Very good product,2
very nyc product,2
Not bad,2
Worst product!!! Keeps on rebooting again and again which is very annoying,2
This router not give good range.,2

To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.,4
Nice phone at this price with good back camera but front camera need sone improvement otherwise performance is very good,5

A great product from Motorola. Always have been a huge fan of moto. The display is amazing and the built quality is superb. All the close up shots from the rear camera are great and the front cam is also good. The audio quality is out of this world!!

Pro's: - Very happy with 120hz refresh rate - Snapdragon 732G is a very efficient processer and works fluently - Battery stays for more than a day - Display quality is amazing and quite bright while using it outdoor - Macro camera is the best while compared to other moto phones -CLEAN SOFTWARE AND VERY CLOSE TO STOCK ANDROID - Very stable videos can be recorded  Con's: -108MP back camera isn't the best - Can expect Amoled display since it's competitors provide the same at this range - This...

Not satisfied with product totally waste of money basically the performance it's not good it doesn't perform well in gaming as well as in battery too Most probably it doesn't have an option of slow-mo also....The collaboration with Google system in dail log as well as in message is totally disgusting..Older oppo mobiles comes with better performance which I've been using since 2018...Don't buy this product really...you will get better mobiles of another brand in this Price range seriously.,2

"Writing this review after 4 months of purchase - 4gb 128gb varient. :- A value for money product ,but performance wise is a little slow,because of helio G25 processor ,if it had snapdragon processor itt would work much efficiently..camera is below average ,battery backup is amazing.. So if you dont do much of work and if you want it for your parents then its good ,but if you are a student then you can try some other option ...",3

Nice very super product and nice performance Battery backup nice,5
To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.üëåüëåüëå,5
Mi 9i is good no loss it is very good mobile any one can take this it's very good I am happy thank you,5

Nice product fits in your budget segment. 1) Battery back up is quite good 2) Nice camera 3) Not a gaming phone 4) Great for normal usage,4
"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3.",4

Compared it with Realme 6 (not an Amoled), I didn't find any difference in quality.

"I was in search of a mobile with long battery life. What I feel is the main purpose of a phone is to talk with a person in need. Taking photo, playing games, watching movie and using internet is secondary work. If the primary purpose fails, all intention will be failed. So it is a nice phone, with clear voice quality and high battery backup. Flipkart delivered the item in time and package was good.",5
"At this price range no better phone could come, good built quality, light, very good call quality with clear sound, loud ringtone. Forget Nokia and Samsung buy Lava with much better quality u won't regret. Itz a steal.",5

Better one but the infinix need improvement in the c type charging and some more updates like remote sensor and display other wise I think good processor now and I don't know after how it will take some more time to charge because it's not 18 Watts charger other wise it's is good phone at this price,4
Really awesome. Nice camera quality both side. Best budget phone of 6/128 in this price segment. Full marks for camera.i have purchased 4 phone hot 10 for me and my frnds..they all likes it..thnx flipkart..,5

"Previously had used infinix note 5, compared to that phone I'm bit unsatisfied. Seems like Infinix has concentrated more on building bigger phone leaving behind the build quality.

To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.üëåüëåüëå,5

"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3.",4

I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò,5
After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.,4
I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.,4
Nice phone iba very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power,5
"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product.",4
I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.,5

"If you really want a fast charging phone, this one is not for you. Fast charging phones are Vooc based and above 20W. Oppo A53 (128G) is taking around 3hrs to fully charge. Rest all features are okayish in all brands today like Mi, Oppo, Realme. I bought a Moto one action last year (128G) and cheaper than this but trust me Moto is better compare to this Oppo A53 in terms of app responsiveness and AI.",3

There is no notification light.",4
"Very big screen and little bulky. But very good mobile. Any how we make it bulky by putting a fancy case. But screen is so big and it might need 2 hands.  Whatever, stock Android, awesome price range, good features. Definitely value for money.  Ordered 2 more after seeing first one.",5

The camera is not upto the mark but well... what can u expect at such a price range. Got mine at 9K for my mom. She's happy with this phone cuz she enjoys watching youtube videos on this big screen and the battery backs up for it. Easy 1-1.5 days of charge at full charge moderate usage. Verdict : If u have a budget of less than 10K go for it. It's worth the price.,4

"On this budget it is worthy to buy this phone. I have received this phone 3 days back. Too early to give detailed analysis but, so far, I am satisfied. My previous Redmi 7A was also excellent and being a Xiaomi product I am confident that this will prove the same way.",5
To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.,4

"The phone is good. It does come with Android 10 (not Android 11), but that is not much of a problem for me. It supports some 4-5 bands of 5g. If I am lucky enough to get even 1-2 of them to match with the ones that will be launched in India(whenever it comes), then it will turn out to a great buy. Phone gets slightly warm (warm not hot) when using personal hotspot, but I feel that's expected. Realme UI experience is also good. Looking forward for a similar performance after Android 11 update.",5
There are very few options in the market for 5G phones at present and none of them come close to Realme Narzo 30 Pro 5G in terms of value for money. Someone who normally uses their phone for at least 3 to 5 years this is a good option. 5G might be rolled out in a year or so and this phone will get one covered for 5G connectivity as it supports up to five different 5G bands which is the second best after Moto G 5G at present.

"This is my first review in flipkart about a product since last 4 years  Now I tell you why you should and shouldn't buy this mobile in detail.  Why you should buy:- 1.

Purchased this product and noticed that it's microphone is not working at video calls at any video calling app.  Reported the problem and requested replacement within time. Technician called to understand the problem and arranged technician visit. Technician checked phone yesterday and find it defected.

"Mobile is good and material seems to be plastic. It is fine as it is low budget mobile. But all nasty apps given in built.

this is all you get for a tiny budget phone like this one. the sound quality and call quality is quite good on this phone. the best part is the battery back-up on this phone. Till now no issue with this phone although i have used for only about a month so far. Not too sure how good it will function in the future.,5

Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..,5
I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò,5
After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.,4
I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.,4
Nice phone iba very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power,5
"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product.",4
I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.,5
I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä,5
Such a amazing phone Delivered 3 days early from the expected date Camera is amazing Processor 720 g is awesome and blazing fast performance Battery is look like a 4500mah battery not like 5000 but still good battery backup. Front camera is 16 megapixel and is still amazing like 48 megapixel camera Only hate the thing that first two sales I didn't get it.    but I recommend you please unboxing the product in front of the delivery boy. The cons is No screen saver No 90 hertz display,5
This is typical of Xiaomi phones. Only exception is phone has less ads Packed with miui 12 features. Camera is pretty good. Nice display and I loved its back design. I dnt play too many games but the performance is very good. Didn't feel any lag.... If u want budget phone and a redmi fan go for it,5
best value for money..i like glass back with Gorilla glass 5 also front .the prosessor is so powerful . display is ok ok . camera good,5
"The phone offers good performance, average display, long battery life, a spectacular design, and a camera that takes good daylight pictures. The poco m2 pro is a value for money device and I believe it is can give tough competition to its closest",5

"Small Basic Phone with good looking small display. user interface is almost the same for the entire samsung guru phones. Phone & Colour looks nice when holding in hand. Call quality is good, recommended for elder people who don't use touch phones.",5
I am writing this review after using it for 7 days it is very nice phone in budget its battery backup is awesome I always suggest this phone if you want to use Dual SIM with long battery backup such type of phone is very beneficial in long journey as well as if you stay more time out of the home its camera quality is average but design is very stylish and the main thing is that you are carrying a Samsung phone,5

Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery, Comes to the products, when I opened and setting up, phone used to hanged sometimes but after update I think it will be ok, it comes with latest sd 678 so i dont have much idea about it but i think it's not good for gaming. Camera is ok both front and back. Battery is 5000mah but draining quite faster so it feels like 4000 mah. But it's has 33w fast charger so it will take around 1hour to full.

Very good phone kindly use this product first then you should read the reviews. I would suggest you ignore the reviews this is best phone for mid range segment do not expect to perform a 13k product like 30k item,5
"Awesome phone comes with awesome features..at this..Price Range ,Nyc display,decent camera and fast charging ,sueprb value for money There is no any phone in the market who give this type of feature in middle range budget.",5
Display is fantastic at this price point. Battery is not bad (but acts like a 4500 mah unit). Build is sleek and lightweight considering its battery capacity. Speakers are good in clarity but slightly low in volume Camera is good considering the price. Processor is good for normal day to day tasks. Phone gets slightly warmer ever for prolonged casual usage. Overall at the price of 12500 to 13500 I can confidently recommend it to anyone.,4
Good one. I bought it in the lockdown they deliver as the said. This phone overall performance is super for this cost. This is miracle to get such a branded one from flipcart. Thanks to flipcart.,5
"Best product in this range. I would recommend this phone. Samsung giving its best products in all variants. Thank you flipkart, i recieved this phone on the very second day. Amazing experience. Thank you flipkart and samsung",5
"Highly recommend  Good phone with awesome battery and display and operating system. But camera is not so good and the mobile is heavy (weight-200 gm). Not good for pubg and call up duty ,this type of games.",4
Takes too much time even in fast charging to go from 0 to 100. Decent enough display. But camera imsges are not upto d mark. People going with image quality pls dont buy this. Otherwise its a good bugrt phone,3
Bought it for my mom . She loved it So good enough for me as well  The phone is having a good battery capacity and it's good in performance as well. The camera could be a way bit more better I guess,5
I am not happy with this product. Unecessary apps are installed which I don't need. Preloaded ytmusic takes lot of time to play song from device. Google music player is missing. Lots of Samsung Galaxy apps are distrubing .  But I would like thank Flipkart to delivered my product on time in this pendemic situation.,1
"I got this phone on 3rd day so first of all thanks to flipkart and Samsung. Battery backup is good as l use it for 10 hours of online meeting. The camera is good as it is 13mp. The processor is slightly old but good. Display is the best. I liked it. Due to online meeting I had bought it. But go for Realme narzo series, vivo y11, or poco m2 pro but it is also a great product. I have bought it for 14,299 rupees.",4
"I recently purchased this phone and I‚Äôm quite satisfied with it. The front camera is not as good but then again for this price it‚Äôs pretty fair. Overall the battery is good, display is awesome, and it is so pretty to look at too. I like it and would definitely recommend for people who aren‚Äôt all that concerned about detailed features and just want a sustainable phone.",5

So if you dont do much of work and if you want it for your parents then its good ,but if you are a student then you can try some other option ...",3
"It is an good phone ever i see, but it have only one problem For safety the network will be slow,but ever it is good product and value for money and good for gaming and Camera perfectly ok, hd display and 64gb rom",5
Nice very super product and nice performance Battery backup nice,5
To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.üëåüëåüëå,5
Mi 9i is good no loss it is very good mobile any one can take this it's very good I am happy thank you,5
"Nice mobile, good battery backup, camera satisfactory, display is awesome, sound quality satisfactory, nice internet speed. Best mobile at this range. Highly recommended",5
Nice product fits in your budget segment. 1) Battery back up is quite good 2) Nice camera 3) Not a gaming phone 4) Great for normal usage,4
"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3.",4

"This iPhone SE is the best phone ever you get. Beautifully designed gives a classy look in your palms. Moreover, performance wise it is a benchmark. You will not be disappointed in this budget. My purchase point was its size. If you are looking for the same you won‚Äôt be disappointed.  I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone.  Best features with stunning looks & performance.  Battery life is very good... READ MORE",5
"Who all loves older size i.e., 4.7 inch type should definitely go for this. Nothing is better than XR, XS or 11. Best for price and usage.",5
This is my second iphone after iphone 4s. I‚Äôve been a long time android user in between. I‚Äôll tell you who this phone is for. Prospective buyers can then decide  1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn‚Äôt do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are ...

Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time. Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.,4
As always compact and handy ... with good image stability 4K gives amazing experience Battery capacity is little poor .. it‚Äôs worth buying on this budget.. 4/5 my rating,4
"Totally worth the price if:  - you are a iOS fan - like compact phone - want to switch from android to iPhone - you like clicking some good photos (camera is unbeatable) - you multitask (normal phones get stuck between apps, this will keep you going without a hiatus (lag) - you like to listen to music (have 2 speakers, one on the front, and another below; when I watch a movie with 4d-5d music, it feels like Dolby atmos)  There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into (yo...

"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good.  The BEST thing about this phone is it‚Äôs size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.  The worst thing is it‚Äôs battery. Doesn‚Äôt last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off.",4
"Camera is best. Mobile performance is good. 4.7 inch display phone is handy phone. Battery capacity is not good but in this range phone is good . Dual sim phone and one sim slot supported eSim. Better series in iPhone is X ,XS ,XR and 11. Software iOS 14.3 is latest.",4
"Keep the battery aside and I don‚Äôt see any other reason why you shouldn‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.  Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn‚Äôt care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours. It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that, you know you... READ MORE",4

"Phone offers a good battery back up due to a 720p display. But good part is that it does not appears to be a 720p screen. Good camera, decent UI, Good battery. Overall a nice phone if doesn't want to spend much.",5
Over all really good mobile with this range... Having all gge required hytech features... If u are seeing a cell with good camera quality.. Don't go with this device... It's not having a good camera.. Bt in 11500 v can't expect much.. Abt cameras the colour is very bright and u dnt get a real picture.. Otherwise good for gaming.. Good latest technology.. Bug display.. Good speaker... Something good from tecno brand,5

Really good.,4
Such a amazing phone Delivered 3 days early from the expected date Camera is amazing Processor 720 g is awesome and blazing fast performance Battery is look like a 4500mah battery not like 5000 but still good battery backup. Front camera is 16 megapixel and is still amazing like 48 megapixel camera Only hate the thing that first two sales I didn't get it.    but I recommend you please unboxing the product in front of the delivery boy. The cons is No screen saver No 90 hertz display,5
This is typical of Xiaomi phones. Only exception is phone has less ads Packed with miui 12 features. Camera is pretty good. Nice display and I loved its back design. I dnt play too many games but the performance is very good. Didn't feel any lag.... If u want budget phone and a redmi fan go for it,5
best value for money..i like glass back with Gorilla glass 5 also front .the prosessor is so powerful . display is ok ok . camera good,5
"The phone offers good performance, average display, long battery life, a spectacular design, and a camera that takes good daylight pictures. The poco m2 pro is a value for money device and I believe it is can give tough competition to its closest",5
I AM writing this Review after 7 days use Battery life is 36 hours for average users. Charging speed is Impressive 64% charge only in 30 minutes. Camera is quite good macro shot is most beautifull.. Nice processor.. Excellent sound.. Brightness is also good...  Selfie camera can improve...,5
"Hi all, As I have bought Poco M2 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this. I would give you my honest experience.. I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons of this phone, 1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 1.21 hrs. 2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than ...

This phone comes with decent specifications....And the audio output is pretty good. One who is looking for best camera then you should not buy this..though it has a samsung isocell camera sensor..it struggles a lot while focusing...Redmi note 7 pro even came with sony sensor...then i don't know why the upcoming phones are coming with samsung sensor While coming to the battery part...it gives a excellent battery backup..Screen On time would be 9.5hrs max .

Awesome mobile... Great experience.... Battery backup is great... After full charge I used it 26hrs continuously.....Specially macro camera is superb... Those who likes photography this phone is best in this budget... & I suggest to buy it....,5
Overall the phone is good. Have bought Starry Blue color and it looks beautiful. There is a glow/ reflection in the light that makes it stand out. Camera is above average and the shots taken capture good detail . Night / low light shots are strictly average. Battery is excellent. Box includes a soft case. Side finger print sensor unlocks fast if used correctly else it is hit or miss. For fast unlocks you will have to ideally use the right hand thumb. Audio is good but A53 was better as th...

"I've used Oppo F7 and Reno 10X pro. Reno 5 pro is in between them. Cons: Photo quality is not up to the mark, or up to the hype (especially sharpness is not there) Phone really heats up - you can really feel it when you watch videos, more during camera app. I've not played games, I'm pretty much sure it will be hot like an iron box.

"The OPPO Reno5 Pro may quite possibly the most exquisite-looking phone in its price range. The MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ chipset adds a significant performance boost, The cameras are a work of art and the charging speeds are ridiculously fast. If you crave a premium-ness in design, combined with reasonably high-level performance and stunning photos and videos, the Reno5 Pro is the perfect option.",5

"Worth purchasing This phone has a ridiculously loud stereo speaker and sound volume is also better than many smartphones. The phone rattles in the vibration, so good vibration motor. The battery is huge for a feature phone. It takes some time getting used to its UI and figuring out all the functions but its worth it. The camera is VGA and pictures are pretty much useless.

"Just worth. Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery, Comes to the products, when I opened and setting up, phone used to hanged sometimes but after update I think it will be ok, it comes with latest sd 678 so i dont have much idea about it but i think it's not good for gaming. Camera is ok both front and back. Battery is 5000mah but draining quite faster so it feels like 4000 mah. But it's has 33w fast charger so it will take around 1hour to full.

Actually this is very amazing product . I compared with many phones like redmi note 10 pro/max and many other phone like vi vo oppo samsung This is quite good and superb product. Thit has 48mp camera but it gives natural colour than 64 mp and 108,5

Very good phone kindly use this product first then you should read the reviews. I would suggest you ignore the reviews this is best phone for mid range segment do not expect to perform a 13k product like 30k item,5
"Awesome phone comes with awesome features..at this..Price Range ,Nyc display,decent camera and fast charging ,sueprb value for money There is no any phone in the market who give this type of feature in middle range budget.",5
Display is fantastic at this price point. Battery is not bad (but acts like a 4500 mah unit). Build is sleek and lightweight considering its battery capacity. Speakers are good in clarity but slightly low in volume Camera is good considering the price. Processor is good for normal day to day tasks. Phone gets slightly warmer ever for prolonged casual usage. Overall at the price of 12500 to 13500 I can confidently recommend it to anyone.,4
Most underrated phone!! 1. 90 hrtz display refresh rate 2. Light in weight 3. Handy phone/ easy to carry device 4. 5000 mah battery with 18w fast charger 5. Type C charger,5

It's not fast as per the configuration. I am using last 3 months and it is started slid hang. Direct video call it will not work like jio to jio. You have to dippend on WhatsApp or other app for video call. I will suggest before purchasing please compare.,1
"A good mobile under this price range. Looks good, I have the Pearl White coloured mobile which looks like a premium smartphone. 90Hz refresh rate screen which is totally awesome. The camera quality is good but not the best. Battery capacity is good. But the processor is somewhat in the lower side.

Pros :- 1) Battery is long lasting. 2) Looks is great 3) Front camera is great. 4) 90 hz screen refresh rate is awesome. Cons:- 1) fast charging doesn't work decently. 2) processor is really slow. 3) back cameras are below average.,3
"Wow, nice phone. Camera is good. But I was disappointed by the processor,it should be like Snapdragon 665 or something. But the phone is good and performance is good and smooth. So thank you for this phone",5

very good product... thanks,4
Its good. U can go for it. Impressive sound quality. Headphone is good memory slot available. Lucrative colour and also good design,5
"Pros: simple to use, good speaker sound, Good battery, elegant and sleek design, Brand value.  Cons: Little costly as per features. Camera is actually 0.3 Megapixel but flipkart mentioned it as 3 MP which is misguiding buyers. Display pixels are too large. Navigation key is too small and people with big thumb can not use it precisely.",3
Phone appearance is really cool it gives smart look also gold colour also great work performance is also great,5
well I can't express it properly because my friend father Is the user of this device so he probably know it better and from my point of view it is good for him.,4

"Just worth. Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery, Comes to the products, when I opened and setting up, phone used to hanged sometimes but after update I think it will be ok, it comes with latest sd 678 so i dont have much idea about it but i think it's not good for gaming. Camera is ok both front and back. Battery is 5000mah but draining quite faster so it feels like 4000 mah. But it's has 33w fast charger so it will take around 1hour to full.

Very good phone kindly use this product first then you should read the reviews. I would suggest you ignore the reviews this is best phone for mid range segment do not expect to perform a 13k product like 30k item,5
"Awesome phone comes with awesome features..at this..Price Range ,Nyc display,decent camera and fast charging ,sueprb value for money There is no any phone in the market who give this type of feature in middle range budget.",5
Display is fantastic at this price point. Battery is not bad (but acts like a 4500 mah unit). Build is sleek and lightweight considering its battery capacity. Speakers are good in clarity but slightly low in volume Camera is good considering the price. Processor is good for normal day to day tasks. Phone gets slightly warmer ever for prolonged casual usage. Overall at the price of 12500 to 13500 I can confidently recommend it to anyone.,4
Most underrated phone!! 1. 90 hrtz display refresh rate 2. Light in weight 3. Handy phone/ easy to carry device 4. 5000 mah battery with 18w fast charger 5. Type C charger,5

Camera üì∏ 3 üåü Outdoor good but indoor just ok Looks very nice Battery good Display good,4
It's not fast as per the configuration. I am using last 3 months and it is started slid hang. Direct video call it will not work like jio to jio. You have to dippend on WhatsApp or other app for video call. I will suggest before purchasing please compare.,1
"A good mobile under this price range. Looks good, I have the Pearl White coloured mobile which looks like a premium smartphone. 90Hz refresh rate screen which is totally awesome. The camera quality is good but not the best. Battery capacity is good. But the processor is somewhat in the lower side.

Pros :- 1) Battery is long lasting. 2) Looks is great 3) Front camera is great. 4) 90 hz screen refresh rate is awesome. Cons:- 1) fast charging doesn't work decently. 2) processor is really slow. 3) back cameras are below average.,3
"Wow, nice phone. Camera is good. But I was disappointed by the processor,it should be like Snapdragon 665 or something. But the phone is good and performance is good and smooth. So thank you for this phone",5

Overall go for it... Won't regret ..üëç,5
Got the product after waiting for agesüòè Anyway am in love with the phone and happy to purchase it.

"Best product in this range. I would recommend this phone. Samsung giving its best products in all variants. Thank you flipkart, i recieved this phone on the very second day. Amazing experience. Thank you flipkart and samsung",5
"Highly recommend  Good phone with awesome battery and display and operating system. But camera is not so good and the mobile is heavy (weight-200 gm). Not good for pubg and call up duty ,this type of games.",4
Takes too much time even in fast charging to go from 0 to 100. Decent enough display. But camera imsges are not upto d mark. People going with image quality pls dont buy this. Otherwise its a good bugrt phone,3
Bought it for my mom . She loved it So good enough for me as well  The phone is having a good battery capacity and it's good in performance as well. The camera could be a way bit more better I guess,5
I am not happy with this product. Unecessary apps are installed which I don't need. Preloaded ytmusic takes lot of time to play song from device. Google music player is missing. Lots of Samsung Galaxy apps are distrubing .  But I would like thank Flipkart to delivered my product on time in this pendemic situation.,1
"I got this phone on 3rd day so first of all thanks to flipkart and Samsung. Battery backup is good as l use it for 10 hours of online meeting. The camera is good as it is 13mp. The processor is slightly old but good. Display is the best. I liked it. Due to online meeting I had bought it. But go for Realme narzo series, vivo y11, or poco m2 pro but it is also a great product. I have bought it for 14,299 rupees.",4
"I recently purchased this phone and I‚Äôm quite satisfied with it. The front camera is not as good but then again for this price it‚Äôs pretty fair. Overall the battery is good, display is awesome, and it is so pretty to look at too. I like it and would definitely recommend for people who aren‚Äôt all that concerned about detailed features and just want a sustainable phone.",5
Very good Battery awesome,5
Super,5
nice camera and very nice phone very low price this is good phone I suggest all who purchase new phone in lowest price it is better than other phone,5
"Absolutely loved the picture quality! For the price offered, realme 3i is definitely a great buy! The fact that it was written 8MP on the box packaging had me concerned for some time but when I reached out to realme and Flipkart, they confirmed that it was just a misprint on a few boxes, it really is of 13MP. Been using it for almost 4 days now and I must say, I'm pretty impressed! Also, great battery backup and commendable performance. Overall, realme 3i is the best in the price segment!",5
brought for my brother on his birthday .. he was so happy to see the phone and must se value for money ...even there is a option no cost EMI which is best for those who want to save money . great phone came with phone case which is a great thing and also in case there is a small door kind of thing in charger area which protects the charging point .,5

Thank you Flipkart. I am a regular customer from last 11years. Also the delivery boy's behavior was good and polite. I am very happy to receive my product.,5
It is the best phone ever in this price range. It also computed with the many costly phones. It's camera is the best and performs like dslr. It's battery is super awesome it lasts for very long and even charges very fastly,5
"Evidently, Smartphone ka Champion! *_* I was surprised when I found out that the outer box had 8 MP camera on it, given it takes such great quality pictures! I just got a mail from the company confirming that it was a sticker print issue and has a 13 MP. Needless to say, realme has to be the best in the market, right from the features offered in after- sales service! If I haven't said it enough, the camera quality is superb, go for it. Highly recommend it to the ones looking for a classy budg... READ MORE",5

"Beyond expectations Display- although display is 720p. you won't notice any major difference between fhd+ and this hd+ panel . I was conscious about ordering this device coz of hd + panel so I was thinking about real me u1(inferior camera and poor battery life), honor 10 lite(good camera , fhd+ panel but poor battery no after sales support of both service and software, used honor 6x before poor battery, no after sales support , no software updates ) no other trusted fhd+ device in this range....

Perfect phone for people whose budget is low. Excellent battery performance as well as overall phone performance. 1. The great thing about this phone is its back portion that is the back is rough which gives great grip while holding in hand. 2. Negative- You can't play games even the smaller games like subway surfers. It lags.,4

"LG W31 is an amazing phone and is best value for money. The phone has a large screen, good & nice touch, speaker is good, responds nicely to signal strength, , crystal clear sound and no lagging while streaming video etc . Built quality is decent ticks all parameters perfectly and is best value for money. LG as we all know is a trusted brand of South Korea with manufacturing facility in India.",5
This Is The Best Non Chinese Phone Under 10K. Display Is Quiet Good And Cameras Are Also Better Than What I Expected. Phone Is Very Lightweight And Compact To Hold By Even A Single Hand. Performance Is Great For Day To Day Usage. However This Phone Is Not For Heavy Gamers.,5
"Never expected that lg phone is this much perfect. Amoung the traditional blind belief of other leading brands lg has done a fantastic job in w31. It's great in terms of built quality, satisfactory cams, touch response etc. Moreover I got an extra budget phone costing 7999 with 4gb 64 and 6.52"" Ips lcd display. Nowhere in online I received with this features. Thanks a lot Lg and Flipkart. Sometimes we need to think differently for a change in taste n satisfaction",5

Great deal for a feature phone with loud and clear sound in this budget with all needed features. Camera is not so much good but you can't expect so much at this price point and calling voice comes from speaker located at back of the mobile which may affect the calling quality. otherwise nice phone.,5

Compact size 7. 1 Year replacement guarantee 8. Play FM without headset with FM recording Cons: 1. No headset in the box which is acceptable in this price 2. No Vibration,4
"First of all it is good product!!! If we consider price, it is good enough. Surplus is that it is made in India. Let us discuss some others features. It has double sim and supports SD card as well. Sound quality, it just banged. One marquee feature is save your battery. It is just awesome, if we compare it in its kind of mobiles.

In this case it beats it's Chinese rivals ,if you are a normal user you can buy this",4
Everything thing is gud at this price. The phone is fully worth it. Nd even comparing this model with the other smartphones offer by the Chinese company like oppo-vivo-redmi-realme is not that much fair as Lava is an Indian company which don't have that much financial support like those companies. Yet by this model it is clear that the company is trying very hard to compete with the others. Although no one will deny that their is a large scope of improvement specially in the software.

"Based on the Budget it exceeds expectations. Also, it's an Indian brand which I believe is the most important factor for me. I might have been slightly liberal with the review but I strongly believe if we support by buying Indian brands and give constructive feedback it will bring in good competition to Chinese phones.

Very nice mobile.,5
I am writing this review after one week of usage. I purchased it for my father. He uses only basic things. Just couple of times WhatsApp and for phone calls and sometimes videos on YouTube or some channel app. When used for watching videos the battery goes down pretty quickly. So that is one drawback. So good for light users like senior citizens. The mobile is good in this price with a big screen but battery could be better.,4
Good one for smartphone beginners also suitable for children online class budjet segment it's ok but here available some similar price better than M02,4
"The phone is very best at this price , whatever you can get 4gb ram from other companies but Samsung is unbeatable . Cons Sim tray is of plastic Back panel plastic , No cover No fast charger Pros Samsung brand 5000mah battery Camera is good at this price",4
Very good product,5
Phone is worth money. It's slick and light and good camera quality. But only one problem is heating problem. Rest all are good.,4
Worst of Samsung I returned it 1 star is also I am giving by force to write a review camera have no options heating too much don't have basic features like game launcher and pop up notifications low quality games are also lagging,1
Bad product and hanging issues very slow phone,1
1. Poor camera quality... they are told 13MP + 2MP | 5MP Front Camera but realty is different. 2. Heating problem 3. Slow Performance but the screen is too large not happy with the Samsung Galaxy M02 I am not recommend to anyone buy this phone.,1
Good Product.,5
Head phones are not in box,3

"Pros: Received product as described. Phone is great one for the price, great screen and performance and battery. Cons: I purchased 64 GB Samsung Micro SD card from Flipkart as well.

Very nice mobile.,5
I am writing this review after one week of usage. I purchased it for my father. He uses only basic things. Just couple of times WhatsApp and for phone calls and sometimes videos on YouTube or some channel app. When used for watching videos the battery goes down pretty quickly. So that is one drawback. So good for light users like senior citizens. The mobile is good in this price with a big screen but battery could be better.,4
Good one for smartphone beginners also suitable for children online class budjet segment it's ok but here available some similar price better than M02,4
"The phone is very best at this price , whatever you can get 4gb ram from other companies but Samsung is unbeatable . Cons Sim tray is of plastic Back panel plastic , No cover No fast charger Pros Samsung brand 5000mah battery Camera is good at this price",4
Very good product,5
Phone is worth money. It's slick and light and good camera quality. But only one problem is heating problem. Rest all are good.,4
Worst of Samsung I returned it 1 star is also I am giving by force to write a review camera have no options heating too much don't have basic features like game launcher and pop up notifications low quality games are also lagging,1
Bad product and hanging issues very slow phone,1
1. Poor camera quality... they are told 13MP + 2MP | 5MP Front Camera but realty is different. 2. Heating problem 3. Slow Performance but the screen is too large not happy with the Samsung Galaxy M02 I am not recommend to anyone buy this phone.,1

This is the best smart phone in cheap price the camera quality is very good .The phone even looks classy,4
Free fire gaming performance is impressive. I play it in ultra setting .It runs very smoothly without a single % of laging. camera is avrage. A little disapoint because there is a lack of fingerprint sencor. but it is face unlock. battery is big 4030 mah so i can play games for long time. Charging speed is average. Screen is big (6.22) so your video & gaming experience will be great. It is a value for money product . Prossecor is good (helio 22p ) for gaming.,4

Such a amazing phone Delivered 3 days early from the expected date Camera is amazing Processor 720 g is awesome and blazing fast performance Battery is look like a 4500mah battery not like 5000 but still good battery backup. Front camera is 16 megapixel and is still amazing like 48 megapixel camera Only hate the thing that first two sales I didn't get it.    but I recommend you please unboxing the product in front of the delivery boy. The cons is No screen saver No 90 hertz display,5
This is typical of Xiaomi phones. Only exception is phone has less ads Packed with miui 12 features. Camera is pretty good. Nice display and I loved its back design. I dnt play too many games but the performance is very good. Didn't feel any lag.... If u want budget phone and a redmi fan go for it,5
best value for money..i like glass back with Gorilla glass 5 also front .the prosessor is so powerful . display is ok ok . camera good,5
"The phone offers good performance, average display, long battery life, a spectacular design, and a camera that takes good daylight pictures. The poco m2 pro is a value for money device and I believe it is can give tough competition to its closest",5

I am writing this review after one week of usage. I purchased it for my father. He uses only basic things. Just couple of times WhatsApp and for phone calls and sometimes videos on YouTube or some channel app. When used for watching videos the battery goes down pretty quickly. So that is one drawback. So good for light users like senior citizens. The mobile is good in this price with a big screen but battery could be better.,4
Good one for smartphone beginners also suitable for children online class budjet segment it's ok but here available some similar price better than M02,4
"The phone is very best at this price , whatever you can get 4gb ram from other companies but Samsung is unbeatable . Cons Sim tray is of plastic Back panel plastic , No cover No fast charger Pros Samsung brand 5000mah battery Camera is good at this price",4
Very good product,5
Phone is worth money. It's slick and light and good camera quality. But only one problem is heating problem. Rest all are good.,4
Worst of Samsung I returned it 1 star is also I am giving by force to write a review camera have no options heating too much don't have basic features like game launcher and pop up notifications low quality games are also lagging,1
Bad product and hanging issues very slow phone,1
1. Poor camera quality... they are told 13MP + 2MP | 5MP Front Camera but realty is different. 2. Heating problem 3. Slow Performance but the screen is too large not happy with the Samsung Galaxy M02 I am not recommend to anyone buy this phone.,1
Good Product.,5
Head phones are not in box,3
"Using this product more than 5 months, no words to say..... It's amazing amazing . A good looking one. Look like iphone have very short memory space.but a memory Card can resolve it. Battery capacity is superbüëç. Battery life is extended to 3,4 days without charging",4
"Great product from Karbonn!!! Really I bought this for my dad he is super happy,, and it something looks like iPhone 5s...;-)",5
It's Amazing phone in this price segment but audio quality is not good and build quality too. But according to price the design of the phone is excellent copy of iPhone 3.,5

The phone is good and very basic. The screen is a bit delicate and needs to be made sure that it doesn't drop on ground or else the screen needs to be replaced. Battery lasts for at least 2 days even after playing radio all day long. Best part is the auto call recorder.,5
Super duper fast phone,5

I just got a mail from the company confirming that it was a sticker print issue and has a 13 MP. Needless to say, realme has to be the best in the market, right from the features offered in after- sales service! If I haven't said it enough, the camera quality is superb, go for it.

Perfect phone for people whose budget is low. Excellent battery performance as well as overall phone performance. 1. The great thing about this phone is its back portion that is the back is rough which gives great grip while holding in hand. 2. Negative- You can't play games even the smaller games like subway surfers. It lags.,4

Battery backup is no doubt awesome bass is also good but sound could be better quality still good but in the box no charging cable and no extra earbud this is what i dont like overall ur budget is low and looking for neckband with bass and great battery backup then u can consider it,3

Felt problem with PC/computer Bluetooth 4.0 not much range. If ur phone is Bluetooth 5.0 go for it.  Edit: After using it for 1 week. Very good battery backup. Nice sound clarity, bass loving it. Really it has 30 hours backup. Very happy with the product. Let's see how long it will run without any issue 1 year or 2 years. This is Flagship killer .",5

This product is acctullly best. best coloty and design. But sound is little low not bed its a perfect but little low. bass is very powerful and clear. battery backup is very best in this price range. definately you purchase this product.,4
This neckband looks good for its price especially for the battery backup and fast charging. Sound is good but bass could have been more and better. Have to use and check more for better opinion. Call quality is good though... Cons are that it doesn't fit that well into the ears and right side feels little heavy cos of remote buttons on the right cable.,4
"Writing this review after using more than 15 days. 255F pro+ has super sound quality. Bass is decent and fair enough. Most important highlight of this headset is battery life,it's amazing. Runtime depends on usage but definitely it will give you more than any other headset. Should go for it.",5
"The battery life is really amazing, on average use of 4-5 hrs per day it lasts upto 5-6 days on 50-60% volume. Also the fast charging really works, you will get 10hrs battery backup with 10 minutes of charge, whereas it takes 1.5 hrs for full charge which is good. The mic does have noise cancellation and quality of voice over mic is very good. The build quality is also nice, it feels durable and the fit is good and snuggly.  My opinion:- Its the best bluetooth collar band in this price segme... READ MORE",5

"Boat is getting better in sound over time and this one is my 4th product, still it suffering to produce clarity. But it is disappointing to see the cheap materials and lousy designs are been accepted. Material quality is no at all near to good, thats means it won't last long. Battery backup is really good, been 27 hours and still running, though battery housing is not sealed properly to provide IPX7 capability, Image attached.

"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model. Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say. Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good.",5
"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving.

Great product in the price range. Decent sound quality with moderate bass. Noice cancellation is below average. Good microphone for making calls. Fit in th ear perfectly.,4
It's a nice product for the price good sound quality and also it maintains a good bass also but it not suitable for play pubg very deficult to spot enimes mi basic headset is better for play pubg at this price range,5
These earphones are pretty basic yet they fail to provide the bare minimum one expects from budget oriented earphones. Boat is known for its bass and sturdy built quality and both were missing in this model. The wire length of the earphones are small and doesn't provide the extra freedom to move whem plugged in. BOTTOM LINE put few more bucks and go for basshead 225 or 220 or if you are short on cash Flipkart smart buy basic earphones are still better than this one.,2
So here I want to mention that this earphones are better than boAt bass heads 100 and it's very comfortable to wear ... I have been using that headphones around 4 months but it's very comfortable than that and it has magnet inside it ... I would prefer you to buy this product so go ahead and buy ... And thank you Flipkart and boAt for giving us such an amazing product ...,5
Great product in a very good price range. Light weight and Perfect sound quality with Perfect Bass..... #Basshead...

Got it by the next day of order! Excellent service by Flipkart! The earphone is awsome! the Bass and treble is as perfect to hear! If your device has Dolby Atmos or any sound enhancements them the sound is as perfect as a nature sound. Wire is enogh long. Pros: 1. The sound is excellent. 2. wire is enough long. 3. 3.5mm jack makes it good fr any smartphone. 4. It also has mic. 5. It has an premium look. Cons: 1. Wire is little bit soft. 2. Ear buds are mat finish.,4
Clarity os good but the bass is low and the treble is high. Wired is comparatively good as per it is not the braided cable.,4

But it is disappointing to see the cheap materials and lousy designs are been accepted. Material quality is no at all near to good, thats means it won't last long. Battery backup is really good, been 27 hours and still running, though battery housing is not sealed properly to provide IPX7 capability, Image attached. Now, the bass is better then others in this range but bellow 70 H... READ MORE",3

"Just got my hands on this product. Let me be honest. Build quality pretty good. Everything fine no cracks or openings. Now the most important point - Bass. I have seen many people and many YouTubers telling that bass is bit much. For for me it is pretty well balanced and works out pretty well. I cannot tell much about battery backup. Let me use this for a couple of days. Then I will update my post. Sound quality also good and if you are used to listening to high volume of sound, you can easil... READ MORE",4
"Pros, 1. Good neckband at a decent price 2. Bass is more than average if you want thumping bass then download ""Subwoofer bass"" App then use it with neckband, it would be killer... 3.Metallic body. Cons, 1. Wire is short but that is fine enough. 2. Magnet is not so strong yet it can attract the earbuds. 3. Battery backup is of 2 hours of continuos music and 3 hours for call.

"It's ok for the price. The build quality is actually better than what I expected. Both of the sides have magnets but it's not very strong. Speaking of sound quality, it's good for calls but not good for music. If you are buying this earphone for music purposes then I recommend use an equaliser or a bass booster. I tested the earphones and I barely got 2 hours of battery. The microphone works great and it's good for online classes. The charging time is 2.5 hours but it depends on what kind of ... READ MORE",3

"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure.",5

They are just awesome . no less then JBL. vocals and both are in balance.clear sound even at highest volume. And its pretty good loud too. Totally satisfied at this price.,5
nice product with beautiful design and fast delivery.... once again thank you flipkart,5
Got it by the next day of order! Excellent service by Flipkart! The earphone is awsome! the Bass and treble is as perfect to hear! If your device has Dolby Atmos or any sound enhancements them the sound is as perfect as a nature sound. Wire is enogh long. Pros: 1. The sound is excellent. 2. wire is enough long. 3. 3.5mm jack makes it good fr any smartphone. 4. It also has mic. 5. It has an premium look. Cons: 1. Wire is little bit soft. 2. Ear buds are mat finish.,4
Clarity os good but the bass is low and the treble is high. Wired is comparatively good as per it is not the braided cable.,4
price wise quality good. sound good. Bass is good. Everything about it is good not excellent. wire length is nice not to short nor to long. wire is tangle free. Build quality is good. in ear fit is good. Budget wise one can go for it.,4

"Sound is fine. Call quality is also fine. My main issue is only right one can connect to my device. Left one connects to right one. So if right pair is discharged then I can not use left pair, I mostly use only one of the pair except while listening to music so it would have been nice if I can use both of them individually.",3
Sound qualti Osm But one problem u can't talk properly by using this  Base good Connected with every phone quickly with SIRI and Google Oly for listing songs and game sound it's good  And the design like a big dabba  Good is u can run dance but not sleeps from ear jus change ur buds according to ur ear Large /small/ Mediums are available,4
"Based on my 10 day experience:  This is a value for money product dear readers. Initially, I had doubts regarding how well it'd fit in my ears but after having used it for days now, I can vouch that these are really comfortable(for someone whose ears are just not made for TWS earpods). Furthermore, the battery backup is beyond phenomenal and as far as sound and base are concerned, it's JBL folks. If you're looking for a decent pair of earpods backed by a powerful brand, this is the one.",5
"Extremely good sound and bass. There's 3 sizes of buds in the box to ensure best fit for the ears. Quick pairing and much better sound quality than other products in this price segment.

But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped.

"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios. I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up. But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???",2

Great quality material. Do have noise cancellation too. Better comfort and battery backup than previous model(400). The design is very appealing. Both quality and look is amazing in this range.

This product is so good. My first priority was battery. No doubt the battery service is too good and first charging is working well. But the build quality like air buds and buttons are cheaper. But we can compromise in this price range and to a Indian company. If your first priority is battery means if you are going to use for office works like attending video calls meetings calls then just go for it.,5

Great product in the price range. Decent sound quality with moderate bass. Noice cancellation is below average. Good microphone for making calls. Fit in th ear perfectly.,4
It's a nice product for the price good sound quality and also it maintains a good bass also but it not suitable for play pubg very deficult to spot enimes mi basic headset is better for play pubg at this price range,5
These earphones are pretty basic yet they fail to provide the bare minimum one expects from budget oriented earphones. Boat is known for its bass and sturdy built quality and both were missing in this model. The wire length of the earphones are small and doesn't provide the extra freedom to move whem plugged in. BOTTOM LINE put few more bucks and go for basshead 225 or 220 or if you are short on cash Flipkart smart buy basic earphones are still better than this one.,2
So here I want to mention that this earphones are better than boAt bass heads 100 and it's very comfortable to wear ... I have been using that headphones around 4 months but it's very comfortable than that and it has magnet inside it ... I would prefer you to buy this product so go ahead and buy ... And thank you Flipkart and boAt for giving us such an amazing product ...,5

I have used boAt BassHeads 220 and 225 which is one of the best in ear headphone. and now days I am using boAt BassHeads 900 which is above my expectations so thanks boAt for all these amazing products.,5
"Sound and bass was awesome when u use Dolby digital u feel theater experience, and quality of the product was also good but comfort was good but not great, overall it's a good product",3
"This is my 3rd Boat headset (after bassheads 600 and bassheads 225). The first two were great and this one (the bassheads 900) is the best of the lot! Boat headsets are definitely more bass oriented and don't provide a very balanced output - you can always feel more of the bass without tweaking eq. But, if you're a bass lover, this is the thing to buy at this range. It gets better and better as they are used for some time. This headset is very comfortable and the build quality is pretty good...

"One of the best headphone in this price segment. Although this is my first purchase in such an affordable price bracket, as I don't really know how should the quality. Fairly reasonable packaging and prompt fast delivery by Flipkart. So far I have tested, I am listing down its pros and cons( and will update whenever necessary)-  PROS:- 1. Good build quality and super lightweight, it barely feels that it is even there 2. Spring mounted cord for efficiency. 3. Decent sound quality, i don't thin... READ MORE",5
"I purchased this headphone for online classes and this meets all the requirements . Sound quality is very clear ,noise free . Compatible with all mobile phones having 3.5 mm Jack.

Best product at this low price.",5
"Review as new user: Pros: 1. Impressive bass 2. Nice and easy vocals 3. Good build 4. Cable is eye catching with jack mounted with metal tip and a good initiative to avoid damage from the end.  Cons: Truly speaking no such issue founded right now.  Tips: To check for the bass please do listen to song ""Yours Tonight"" at 80 to 85% volume...  After a month or two, I will update with new reviews on long term use... For now, a good product from house of boAt üëçüéß Thanks for reading... Peac... READ MORE",5

"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model. Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say. Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good.",5
"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving.

"Sound quality, bass and battery backup much better than Oneplus bullets wireless Z thanks to Aptx HD support.  Have used for a week now and am amazed by the performance of the product.

"Great quality Audio. AptX HD does make a difference in the audio quality. Charging is fast. Gets from 0 to full in about 40 minutes. Battery life is not 30 hours. It is around 15 to 20 hours if you are an enthusiast like me and like to keep your volume atleast above 60%. The headset is flexible and it gives a solid feel. Overall I recommend this over Bullets Wireless Z as it sounds better, offers a little more battery life and has AptX HD.",4

Well this product is really appealing just because of it's design (of the earpieces not the box) and affordable!!

Great product in the price range. Decent sound quality with moderate bass. Noice cancellation is below average. Good microphone for making calls. Fit in th ear perfectly.,4
It's a nice product for the price good sound quality and also it maintains a good bass also but it not suitable for play pubg very deficult to spot enimes mi basic headset is better for play pubg at this price range,5
These earphones are pretty basic yet they fail to provide the bare minimum one expects from budget oriented earphones. Boat is known for its bass and sturdy built quality and both were missing in this model. The wire length of the earphones are small and doesn't provide the extra freedom to move whem plugged in. BOTTOM LINE put few more bucks and go for basshead 225 or 220 or if you are short on cash Flipkart smart buy basic earphones are still better than this one.,2
So here I want to mention that this earphones are better than boAt bass heads 100 and it's very comfortable to wear ... I have been using that headphones around 4 months but it's very comfortable than that and it has magnet inside it ... I would prefer you to buy this product so go ahead and buy ... And thank you Flipkart and boAt for giving us such an amazing product ...,5
Great product in a very good price range. Light weight and Perfect sound quality with Perfect Bass..... #Basshead...

They are just awesome . no less then JBL. vocals and both are in balance.clear sound even at highest volume. And its pretty good loud too. Totally satisfied at this price.,5
nice product with beautiful design and fast delivery.... once again thank you flipkart,5
Got it by the next day of order! Excellent service by Flipkart! The earphone is awsome! the Bass and treble is as perfect to hear! If your device has Dolby Atmos or any sound enhancements them the sound is as perfect as a nature sound. Wire is enogh long. Pros: 1. The sound is excellent. 2. wire is enough long. 3. 3.5mm jack makes it good fr any smartphone. 4. It also has mic. 5. It has an premium look. Cons: 1. Wire is little bit soft. 2. Ear buds are mat finish.,4
Clarity os good but the bass is low and the treble is high. Wired is comparatively good as per it is not the braided cable.,4
price wise quality good. sound good. Bass is good. Everything about it is good not excellent. wire length is nice not to short nor to long. wire is tangle free. Build quality is good. in ear fit is good. Budget wise one can go for it.,4

"This is the best which is in less cost that I have found on Flipkart , the sound quality of headset is amazing I didn't expect that it will be this much awesome and also it's colour is speechless and also very descent. At last I strongly suggest that everyone should buy this...üòçüòç",5
Actually sound is good and if you are a bass lover then you definitely like it but the build quality is the major issue The neckband slip one side while walking or running and when you using the shape of the neck band is not consistent mean you have to adjust it again & again,2
"Most exciting product in this budget segment ,bass super, controls are very easy . It was better than realme buds sound quality is very extreme dual bearing option and lightweight easy connect are all awesome but I don't expect this product in this budget segment",5
Excellent product....,4
It's too good awesome design and best sound quality must buy it,5
Very good product. Nice experience... Good quality with high bass and effective sound.,5
Best product for a Price  I am use 2 weeks A sound quality is good Battery backupp is very very good { {after 24+ hours continue } Faster charging is very nice only 40 minutes battery fully charged  So product is very nice for long time battery backup,4
"Build quality is pretty good, good bass and voice.. Comfort fit in the ear..but i don't know the battery backup exactly, and overall is good is in this price range",5
"Sound quality, bass and battery backup much better than Oneplus bullets wireless Z thanks to Aptx HD support.  Have used for a week now and am amazed by the performance of the product. I wonder why people flock to chinese oneplus z in such huge numbers when this Indian company product is obviously better.  Aptx HD is automatically set in my Poco f1 when I pair with the product.  Have used the buds for about 8hrs 2 days ago, today for 1 hr and still the battery is at 60%. Just great",5
Very nice product battery life is a 29 hours 73. minutes . This product is a very good full song full bass and full battery backup my first bluetooth earphone is a JBL 160 this is a not good I am like to boat rockerz 335 full . Investment Yuva no doubt this product I am a I am a very happy thank you Flipkart thank you thank u boat rockerz,5
Super bass and sound quality are amazing total overall performance is 10/ 10 I really love it battary performance 25 hour and build quality super so this better than Sony 310 and oneplus bullet bass edition Realme wireless pro,5
"Great quality Audio. AptX HD does make a difference in the audio quality. Charging is fast. Gets from 0 to full in about 40 minutes. Battery life is not 30 hours. It is around 15 to 20 hours if you are an enthusiast like me and like to keep your volume atleast above 60%. The headset is flexible and it gives a solid feel. Overall I recommend this over Bullets Wireless Z as it sounds better, offers a little more battery life and has AptX HD.",4
This yellow combination is so good and believe me or not its worth of your money metal build body so build quality is awesome far better than Samsung level U 2 eirbuds are greatly adjust in ear  battery backup is very good I have played the newly brought product for hours but still not shut down  bass is awesome better than Jbl or any other product  and the ware is so thick from me 9.5 out of 10 overall,5

It is a good product There are many options to buy neckband but I like Boat rocarz 335 it is better than others neckband There are some reason to buy 1. Sound quality is very good with spacial clarity. 2. Battery backup is very good more than 20 Hrs 3. Color is very good 5. Last it is a Indian brand Please buy indian brand .,5
"Hey Guys,,,,,, if u loves balanced sound signature then it's Really satisfied you. But if you are a basshead type person then Go for Others. Build quality, microphone,connectivity and battery life is really good. But at this price point other brands gives you more features and better Neckband design. I gave 4 stars because I loves balanced sound signature.",4
Loving the sound on these and ease of use. Bass is punchy and full and overall sound is awesome without affecting clarity and vocals. Excellent battery life as well.,5
"Awesome JBL sound! After trying a lot of other headphones, I can say JBL stands it's ground. Class apart sound, specially for bass lovers without comprising on clarity. Easy to use for calls and casual workouts as well. Magnetic buds is a very useful feature.",5
I am happy with JBL Tune 125BT It is very good while having calls and has very good battery backup.,5
"Trust me it has very clear & thumping bass, even in full volume the bass is not distorted. Many people review this that it has no bass, so I told you please plug the ear tips in your ear tightly to make it air tight, then you feel the bass, and trust me friends its sounds very good, every pitch of sound is Cristal clear and balanced even in full volume.",5
"Amazing sound quality, it‚Äôs best for people who like balanced and rich sound quality. Bass is ample and balanced, not over which makes sound quality and music experience very fantastic. Practically Battery backup is just near as mentioned, get around 14-15 hours of battery life at 60-70% volume. Amazing product and delivers quality sound and music experience",5
Super batery backup and nice clear sound.. It wil be Worth the investment,5
JBL Tune125BT is a very good product Very happy with sound quality of 125BT.It has a good bass for music and also a good voice clarity for calls,5

Very good product sound quality is slightly above average bass and treble are average. But the battery pack up is really good it can stand whole day only with listening songs and for call and also it's has fast charging within 10- 15 you can enjoy upto 8 hrs and with full charge it stands upto 10-12 hrs overall very good performance at this price range.

Wow just amazed by the quality. Highly Highly recommended even if we leave the Indian sentiment's behind its absolutely worth it..!!!!,5
This product is so good. My first priority was battery. No doubt the battery service is too good and first charging is working well. But the build quality like air buds and buttons are cheaper. But we can compromise in this price range and to a Indian company. If your first priority is battery means if you are going to use for office works like attending video calls meetings calls then just go for it.,5

I would just say, plug into the Nirvana.",5

Great Product from BoAt Actually I have not reviewed any products for past few years. But reviewing this product since this is so good for the price we pay. Using this for past two days and Iam really impressed with the sound clarity. I did not expect the bass to be as good as this. Call clarity is great. Only problem I faced is connectivity.

I will give you reason why i liked soo much.. 1st- i don't like in ear type earphone, it pains very much in my ear by rubber material.. And also they are not safe, it creates vaccum inside ear, and also while walking and eating, it creates humming sound..  2nd- it is very comfortable, for long hours, perfect fitting in my ea...

"I am writing this review after using the TWS for few days. I purchased this for 1,499/-. Good tws for this price. Sound is good. Indian market usually focus on bass so mivi has given special attention to that. Battery is good, i have used it rigorously but still get decent battery life which totally depends on your use.

I received this duopods on 19th Nov and am using them only once in a day. Till last week they were just working fine. However since last week it my right one has been acting funny. Its works on its own and stops on its own. So whats the point of having good sound quality bass etc.,3
"Good product , good quality and I am very proud to be Indian company ...",5
It doesnt sound good in MI phones. Volume is also not upto the mark.There is some compatibility issue. On other brands it sound very good and sound volume is also pretty good,3
"Sound quality is very good. This product comes with great bass with good battery backup. Pods can be charged near about 3-4 time in case and music playback time of pods are about 4-5hrs. The case took 1.5hrs to get fully charged. But there is no noise cancelation. and the mic quality is poor. While calling, the other person struggles to hear the voice. Otherwise its very good. Its comfortable to wear and Bluetooth range is good.",4
Its touch control and sound quality is good. Its design gives a new definition to the budget earphones. Bass is something that could be better but isn't at the moment.,4

Great quality material. Do have noise cancellation too. Better comfort and battery backup than previous model(400). The design is very appealing. Both quality and look is amazing in this range.

"Writing this review after using more than 15 days. 255F pro+ has super sound quality. Bass is decent and fair enough. Most important highlight of this headset is battery life,it's amazing. Runtime depends on usage but definitely it will give you more than any other headset. Should go for it.",5
"The battery life is really amazing, on average use of 4-5 hrs per day it lasts upto 5-6 days on 50-60% volume. Also the fast charging really works, you will get 10hrs battery backup with 10 minutes of charge, whereas it takes 1.5 hrs for full charge which is good. The mic does have noise cancellation and quality of voice over mic is very good. The build quality is also nice, it feels durable and the fit is good and snuggly.  My opinion:- Its the best bluetooth collar band in this price segme... READ MORE",5

"Boat is getting better in sound over time and this one is my 4th product, still it suffering to produce clarity. But it is disappointing to see the cheap materials and lousy designs are been accepted. Material quality is no at all near to good, thats means it won't last long. Battery backup is really good, been 27 hours and still running, though battery housing is not sealed properly to provide IPX7 capability, Image attached.

"Just got my hands on this product. Let me be honest. Build quality pretty good. Everything fine no cracks or openings. Now the most important point - Bass.

Let me use this for a couple of days. Then I will update my post. Sound quality also good and if you are used to listening to high volume of sound, you can easil... READ MORE",4
The earphones are good quality and bass is good too but for my taste as I don't like bass much and prefer a clearer sound over bass these aren't worth it as even on 70% bass is high and sound gets distorted can't listen to lyrics bass is always annoying but that's personal choice if ur a bass lover go for it otherwise look for other,4
"Removing 1 star for design otherwise this is best in ear headsets. Sound quality is great. Bass is punchy. Crispy Treble Vocals sound clear. Fits really well inside ears no pain. MIC response is ok. I'm enjoying listening music through these. But nothing is perfect in this world. So, below is the reason I took off 1 star. It's all about design. The MIC is at the joint where left and right cables split which makes the voice coming from far. So while on call or using Voice assistant, spea... READ MORE",4

Actually sound is good and if you are a bass lover then you definitely like it but the build quality is the major issue The neckband slip one side while walking or running and when you using the shape of the neck band is not consistent mean you have to adjust it again & again,2
"Most exciting product in this budget segment ,bass super, controls are very easy . It was better than realme buds sound quality is very extreme dual bearing option and lightweight easy connect are all awesome but I don't expect this product in this budget segment",5

Superb quality sound with Good bass and worth buying Thank you...!!,5
Sound quality is outstanding at this price point. I repeat quality.. Bass is good compared to other half in ear headsets. Design is good. Wire quality is superb. But headset is plastic built that is the only con. Otherwise all good... Fitting is good,5
its nice ear phone .Dont believe anything that this does not fit in it fits perfectly.the Sound is very nice.bass is good cant say too good but its perfect in this budget .The quality and Build is superb realme is one of the best Audio Segment,5
"Most of the earphones you get at this price are filled with bass. That bass overpowers everything and all the vocals, instruments in music get destroyed. These realme buds classic are perfectly balanced for me. The bass only appears when it is needed, that's what I like about these earbuds. If you're a bass head you'll hate these, but for beginner audiophiles and more normal users like me, these buds are perfect on a tight budget. The build is good too. The wire is made of a TPU - kind - of m... READ MORE",5

"Hey Guys,,,,,, if u loves balanced sound signature then it's Really satisfied you. But if you are a basshead type person then Go for Others. Build quality, microphone,connectivity and battery life is really good. But at this price point other brands gives you more features and better Neckband design. I gave 4 stars because I loves balanced sound signature.",4
Loving the sound on these and ease of use. Bass is punchy and full and overall sound is awesome without affecting clarity and vocals. Excellent battery life as well.,5
"Awesome JBL sound! After trying a lot of other headphones, I can say JBL stands it's ground. Class apart sound, specially for bass lovers without comprising on clarity. Easy to use for calls and casual workouts as well. Magnetic buds is a very useful feature.",5
I am happy with JBL Tune 125BT It is very good while having calls and has very good battery backup.,5
"Trust me it has very clear & thumping bass, even in full volume the bass is not distorted. Many people review this that it has no bass, so I told you please plug the ear tips in your ear tightly to make it air tight, then you feel the bass, and trust me friends its sounds very good, every pitch of sound is Cristal clear and balanced even in full volume.",5
"Amazing sound quality, it‚Äôs best for people who like balanced and rich sound quality. Bass is ample and balanced, not over which makes sound quality and music experience very fantastic. Practically Battery backup is just near as mentioned, get around 14-15 hours of battery life at 60-70% volume. Amazing product and delivers quality sound and music experience",5
Super batery backup and nice clear sound.. It wil be Worth the investment,5
JBL Tune125BT is a very good product Very happy with sound quality of 125BT.It has a good bass for music and also a good voice clarity for calls,5

Boult ProBass vs BoAt reckerz 225 - I have used both than writing this review. 1. Boult gives surround sound experience whereas Boat rockerz not. 2.

I'm using boat from last 3 to 4 years but i never bought any Bluetooth wireless headset or earphone so this is my first time of purchasing earplugs like this till now the experience is good bass is good also battery backup is good but the case build quality is not up to the mark but if anyone is planning to purchase earplugs in this budget this is a very good deal.,5
After 2 days of use I must admit that it's worth going for it. Excellent qualities for daily use with perfect battery backup. Light weight Good built quality Good Bass Call quality is Crystal clear while using it at home not tested while driving. Music quality is also good. For daily use it is OK at this price range .... recommend to go for it. Pairing issues if faced while using for first time can be easily resolved by seeing the available videos on YouTube!!,5
I bought these during the sale for 1500 and was choosing this over the other noise x1 air 2 at the same price. On the box it is printed by the manufacturer at the price of MRP 5990 so in that sense these earphones out do the 1500 price tag. The most noticeable bit is the bass which is pretty good and high. Volume is good and can listen to it clearly even in the lower ranges. Using it for a day so far and had to charge it for about an hour and it lasted about 4 hours until the right earbud had...

This cannot be compared to boat/realme/OnePlus/oppo or the like. 2. Bass is fine but we can't listen it in volume for long time. Causes pain as opposed to other products. 3.

"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure.",5
The earphones are good quality and bass is good too but for my taste as I don't like bass much and prefer a clearer sound over bass these aren't worth it as even on 70% bass is high and sound gets distorted can't listen to lyrics bass is always annoying but that's personal choice if ur a bass lover go for it otherwise look for other,4
"Removing 1 star for design otherwise this is best in ear headsets. Sound quality is great. Bass is punchy. Crispy Treble Vocals sound clear. Fits really well inside ears no pain. MIC response is ok. I'm enjoying listening music through these. But nothing is perfect in this world. So, below is the reason I took off 1 star. It's all about design. The MIC is at the joint where left and right cables split which makes the voice coming from far. So while on call or using Voice assistant, spea... READ MORE",4
I had buy this earphone something 1 year ago . Its quality was good and i was satisfied .It worked for 6 months and one side of the earphone stop working .then i replaced it in warranty. I got new.

I think it was a manufacturing defect .so i am unsatisfied with this earphone .It has a same problem with same period of time so don't buy it . Its my honest review.,1
It's have HD sound quality very crystal clear.. first thing noticible is the bass..It is excellent in terms of bass very enjoyable pure bass.The build quality is also decent everything is well put together..

"Pros : Good punchy sound. Great bass levels. Tangle free cord. Angled jack.  Cons: The plastic section in contact with ear lobe can hurt after prolonged use.

Only buy this if you're on a budget and have a OnePlus phone and don't know who an audiophile is. Also if you're obsessed with meetings/phone calls/audiobooks.  Expect disappointment with sound quality(2.5/5) due to: 1. Codec limitations (AAC Only) 2. Buds designed for bass only: The mids are usually muffled up due to the bass and the highs are a bit blunt.

Review after one week of usage . I am getting a battery backup of 7-8hours a day. Bass is not that much good but still its nice. Only you have to do is adjust the equilizer in your phone for better bass and quality sound. It has a good latency and best for gaming like Pubg.

I was looking for a budget BT earphones for my husband and landed here. Ordered and gifted to him he was excited after getting it as this was my first ever gift to him. The earphones are really looking good on wearing across the neck. The in-ear style design fits inside the ears comfortably and stays there if you do light running or do workout. The sound quality is also OK best thing is the Bass quality of it which Indian likes most. Build quality seems good and design is excellent.,5

I thought the product is very good because of the five start review of the product. but I was wrong because when I see the sound quality it is not as good as expected. bass quality is also not that much optimum quality.

"Having both pros & cons #Pros : 1. Light weight. 2. Good sound with extra bass. 3. Ear cups aren't huge, therefore ears won't get heated. 4. Mic is another plus point in this range. #Cons : 1. After a long time extra bass is annoying. 2. Soundproof is not good. ( Anybody with bare ears closer to the person with headphone can easily hear what's playing )",4
This is a awesome product. I got it in right time. And everything is good as well..the sound quality is extremely clear and if u listen in full sound then u will get deaf nearly..that the sound is so high.

Nice quality.... its original SONY product And its pros are crystal clear audio and average bass.

All Over Its best budget earphone..and GO FOR IT!!!,5

"Perfect partner for a perfect phone. How good is the sound output and the speed of detection and connection with Oneplus phone is incomparable. If you have a Oneplus device jist go for it and even if you dont have one, know the aound quality is amazing (music and call)",5
Only buy this if you're on a budget and have a OnePlus phone and don't know who an audiophile is. Also if you're obsessed with meetings/phone calls/audiobooks.  Expect disappointment with sound quality(2.5/5) due to: 1. Codec limitations (AAC Only) 2. Buds designed for bass only: The mids are usually muffled up due to the bass and the highs are a bit blunt. You will miss out the essence/beauty of quite a few instruments or the subtle notes that would otherwise add a magical effect for your sy... READ MORE,3

Hope it will stay intact for long time. the sound quality is average. you cant expect it to give heavy bass, if u want heavy bass then go for Boat Bassheads over ear headsets. overall good product. i dont know yet if it is original product. theres no official authentication docs. btw, good product. I'm satisfied.",4
"I compared it with my original Samsung earphones which comes in-box with my Galaxy J5 and Yes they're really genuine and original by Samsung. Coming to sound quality, it's pretty good with clear voice and bass is also good. The build quality is superior as compared to any earphones. My earlier earphones are washed in washing machine twice by mistake and they still survived after that and didn't lose their audio quality.",5
"Used just for a day so will give e detailed review later (regarding durability mainly). For now, 1. Packaging and delivery was well done 2. Earphones came in perfect condition 3. Sound and bass are nice 4. Mic is working well No problems for now. Really good product. This may well be the original product",4

My personal experience really very good headphone amazing work and very good fantastic and super backup bettery is good,5
üíØüíØIt's good to see that this headphone has 40mm drivers which provides a better bass Not the best but it's way better than any other headphones in the market üòéüíØüíØ And the battery backup is just mind-blowing I charged it when I bought it and I am still using bluetooth and micro SD card and stil not discharge yet(almost 4 days and 2 hrs a day),4
I purchased looking at the amazing reviews but i feel the built quality could be better ik one can't ask more at the price range bt the cushion comes out check out for buttons too and the connection wire. i would recommend not to purchase go for something better ......,2

"Sound clarity is crisp, clear and awesome.....Bass is controlled.Build is classy and premium.Overall product is satisfactory you can blindly go for it!!!",4
The first look of the product is amazing. I have used it yesterday and the sound quality is really good. Mic is good. No external sound will be heard. it covers your ear fully. Battery backup I haven't completely tested. I used for 2 hours with Bluetooth and only 10% charge was used. so I guess you will have a good backup as advertised. It is light weight as well. Nice product. Go for it.,5
Nice delivery and nice product,5
Nice product but not best...I'll update after using one week,3

"Honest Review Must Read Before Buying  Buy this if u want to use for calling otherwise battery backup for music it won't good as they are shown in the description. For heavy usage, I m not recommending this product at all.  Buy only if u want to pick few calls and look stylish in front of everyone.",3

Amazing Bluetooth earphones in this price range. No one can beat them. But I feel the on the call due to mic the other person cannot hear properly like the voice is very low other wise they are pretty good in every terms. Great product realme,4
I started using it as soon as I opened the box. The sound quality is really good. Bass is perfect. It is a perfect fit for my ear. Very light weight. Tested it with my Huawei Nova 3i for more than 2 and a half hour of continuous youtube playback. Worked perfectly. The battery icon changed to orange after approx 2 hrs 15 minutes. I guess the battery can last upto 3 hrs. I have no idea about battery backup of other brands. Still my only suggestion is that battery backup can be improved.,5
"Nice product at this price point. Advantages: 1. Automatically connects upon opening flap of pods ; after initial connection through Bluetooth search option 2.

I have received my buds today and they are working perfectly fine. Sound is good for music and used for couple of office calls. So far I have not faced any issue. Touch are sensitive so please use them carefully. Beautifully designed and enjoying it. Read the manual carefully otherwise you may face issue with ear buds sounds like others.,5
"Here are my thoughts, very in-depth. 1. They're cheap. Real cheap, considering an identical pair of earphones from a certain other brand would run you down 25k.  2. Sound: The second most important thing, after price. They're good. They have somewhat of a V shape sound signature so songs sound 'exiciting'. The bass is thumpy and punchy (I guess that's why they call it bass boost drivers), but the very low end near 80hz just isn't there. I'd expected much lower bass presence considering they h...

Many people review this that it has no bass, so I told you please plug the ear tips in your ear tightly to make it air tight, then you feel the bass, and trust me friends its sounds very good, every pitch of sound is Cristal clear and balanced even in full volume.",5
"Amazing sound quality, it‚Äôs best for people who like balanced and rich sound quality. Bass is ample and balanced, not over which makes sound quality and music experience very fantastic. Practically Battery backup is just near as mentioned, get around 14-15 hours of battery life at 60-70% volume. Amazing product and delivers quality sound and music experience",5

Talking about the built quality it is good for this price, whan it comes to sound quality it has a mild mid and treble and the bass is so smooth.

"This product wasn't having a lot of reviews when I bought it. I was a bit worried whether I'm wasting my money. But after I used the airdopes I felt it's worth the money. The sound quality is excellent. During calls, the other person is able to hear your voice properly. The bass is awesome you'll enjoy metal as well as classic with this airdopes. I would just say, plug into the Nirvana.",5
"I have just bought this couple of days back and I am extremely satisfied with the product. It has very good battery back up and lasted for over 5 hrs at a stretch for calls today (didn't test while listening to music yet for a long duration).

Great Product from BoAt Actually I have not reviewed any products for past few years. But reviewing this product since this is so good for the price we pay. Using this for past two days and Iam really impressed with the sound clarity. I did not expect the bass to be as good as this. Call clarity is great. Only problem I faced is connectivity. It takes some time to connect to the right ear bud. Overall looks like a great product from BoAt.üòçüòç,5
"Reviewing after using 3 days.  Sound : So I'm going to tell you in sort and Simple, you'll not get better then this. I've tried JBL, Realme, Apple but they are not for music lovers Maybe they are good for calling.  Design : The only resign of deduction of 1 star. It was somewhat bulky and hevyier.

Customer care number maximum time switch off I used 25days and start the problem loos connection,1
It's not good for many reason 1.it gets hot immediately after few seconds of use 2.sound is also not clear 3. There is always a tingling sound Please replace it as soon as possible,2
"Clear, standard quality sound... ‚ù§ Although the base is slightly low, but enough to satisfy your needs... Highly recommend for professional also... one more if anyone loves listening classical music such as various indian ragas, go for it! trust me the sound of tabla (base) is heavenly..  like it, if i help u little bit :')",5
"Having both pros & cons #Pros : 1. Light weight. 2. Good sound with extra bass. 3. Ear cups aren't huge, therefore ears won't get heated. 4. Mic is another plus point in this range. #Cons : 1. After a long time extra bass is annoying. 2. Soundproof is not good. ( Anybody with bare ears closer to the person with headphone can easily hear what's playing )",4
This is a awesome product. I got it in right time. And everything is good as well..the sound quality is extremely clear and if u listen in full sound then u will get deaf nearly..that the sound is so high. The best thing is that it's look and sound adjustability. I will prefer u blindly go for it.And I m giving this review after 4 months of daily use and its same as before. Thanks flipkart. üôÇ,5
Nice quality.... its original SONY product And its pros are crystal clear audio and average bass. And the cons i found was that its one side becomes louder than other sometimes and also cause variation when plugged in high volt devices like computer and low volt devices like smartphone and mp3.And it was little bit smaller in size than i expected. All Over Its best budget earphone..and GO FOR IT!!!,5
"Okay, So you're probably confused on buying these or not. If you're comparing these with the Moto Pulse 2 and Pulse Max, Then you need to read on. Okay so almost after 2 days of torturing tough usage, I came up with these points. ---Pros--- 1.Good Balance between treble and bass 2.Comfortable padding, covers the ears almost completely, as these are on the ear headphones instead of over the ear ones. 3.

Dark Side : 1. Sound does not converge well when in a very busy market place. 2. Does not produce very loud sound as people may like when they see any product related to sound.  Bright Side : 1. Excellent build quality. Super finish as expected from Sony. Portable design. 2. Does not pain ears at all even after using for hours continuously. But at some point it may pain. I suggest removing the device for 5 minutes when it pains. 3. Sound is brilliant considering people are not wild. Good bas... READ MORE,5

It comes along with a Micro Usb Cable whoes quality is also nice, It take around 2 hrs to fully charge. No complaints regarding this product. And yes You can't compare this with neckbands over Rs.1000.",5
Does the job. Is a well known brand and fulfills all the promises it makes. You can see the detailed features on product page on Amazon. I am not an expert but as a regular user I can say I am happy with the purchase. Sound is good. Noise cancellation also as it should be.,5
After 3 days the right earbud stopped working  After buying I was so happy but man what a disappointment why isn't it working is it wrong with mine only or it's like that... I don't know.. Except this battery life is good and sound quality is good and bass is not that good..,1
Used for a day. So this is my first impression. Sound clarity is amazing. Touch sensors and battery backup is also good. Ears might hurt after prolonged use. But according to the price I'd say it's pretty decent. I deducted two stars for the lack of comfort and because sometimes the voice cracks on a call. Otherwise it's okay.,3
"Beautiful earphones.. No need to spend 4000-5000 Rs, beautiful Indian earbuds in just reasonable price .. fulfilling all requirements. EXTRA ORDINARY QUALITY..",5

The ergonomics of this is horrible. My ears start hurting after a while especially if I'm wearing it during a call.  The sound quality is very bad too. You need to ensure that their is no loud ambient noise in the vicinity.,1

"the quality is good , base is decent not much if you use any other bass earphones , Battery backup is Excellent means like I am getting upto 6-7 hrs good on 60-70% volume after 6 months and due to BT 5 version latency is low too , but often there is some turbulence happening in between independent of the charge , connectivity or any motion , it's just comes out if nowhere. . Which causes little bit uncomfort.",3
"Design is good. Earphones are comfortable for hours of usage. But no next button function provided, I have used next button in past while playing songs so missing that. Base is good but trible quality is poor. I would suggest for calling usage and movies watch not best for songs. Last point which is very annoying, after battery goes below 30% it starts saying battery low every minute till we charge. Company should remove this feature.",2

"AWESOME...... This one word describes these bass heads 182 by BOAT. The braided cable prevents headset from getting highly tangled, there is mic with button to receive and disconnect calls, the specifically angled jack makes it easy to connect with mobile, PC as well as laptop. But the main thing which is centre of attraction is the sound quality, the BASS HEADS live upto their name, and the sound is crisp even at high volume levels.",5
Awesome Product...!!! This is the best boAt earphone. ‚úìThe sound is very clear. ‚úìDesign looks very good. ‚úìFit in ears. ‚úìFeels good while listening songs. ‚úìIt maintains the bass in such a way so that it would not affect our ears. ‚úìWire is very Strong. ‚úìMic records voice very clearly. √ó Left and Right earphones not works correctly.  *** If you are a music lover then go for it.***,5
Best Earphones ever ..... The sound is crystal clear and a good gaming earphones too ..... I would suggest to buy these ..... These are totally Bass Heads ...,5
PROS: Bass is heavy Ear buds are light ..can use for long periods Wire is long enough and strong. Sound output is too loud...u can't listen at full volume even for a minute. Looks good  CONS: The only con i have found is..' treble '.All they have focused on is bass...treble is very less..  Overall if you are a bass lover like me ... go for it..u will not regret for sure.,5
Sound quality is good but looks a bit cheap and price should b 350 to 400 i don't like an angled hands-free that why i ordered for this if u like angled one than a bit cheap option in boat of 399rs is also available and boat is a brand and giving 1 year warranty so surely it is worth buying i m using Realme 2 pro and sound quality is very good with this device if price is good according to you than surely go for it.,4
I like it because it was so smooth it was very good quality the base was very very good,5

One of the best air pods worth buying it....many people writing that it's not good for calling but I found it all awsome in all aspects.....go for it,5
Good Sound Quality with super battery backup. Plus it is lightweight which makes it very portable. Very easy to pair and connect as well. Definitely recommend this.,5
I loved the performance of the product. It was comfortable to wear and easy to access. When it comes out of the charging box it automatically gets connected to the bluetooth with the lastly paired device.It was a wonderful experience using it. Product has nice grip so that it won't fall off.Its sound is amazing and clear. Nice battery back can use for a long time for whatsoever work may be. Nice was quite appreciable. Can buy this good product.üëç,5
Realitive better earpods . lovely voice and better battery backup then other and must say it is worth to The price....,5
Sounds a good product after using it for a week..one thing missing is a charge percentage indicator in the storage box. I recently bought boat airdopes which had a led indicator to show the battery percentage...but I really like the clip model which holds well around the ears,4
Very good sound quality and Bass. Battery backup is also good with decent build quality. The design is in such a way that buds will not fall down accidentally. Mic quality is little downside...some times the other person is not able to clearly hear our voice but it's not too bad. It's obvious since the mic is on our ear and not close to mouth. A really good option in this price range. Got this for 1199 during offer period.,5
Not a great product but does its perfectly and the most important thing is that it is not a Samsung product it is a clone one but the battery life is not good at all it is stable for sports purposes and it has noise cancelling too. Great product for my end. I am happy with it üëç,4

They are just awesome . no less then JBL. vocals and both are in balance.clear sound even at highest volume. And its pretty good loud too. Totally satisfied at this price.,5
nice product with beautiful design and fast delivery.... once again thank you flipkart,5
Got it by the next day of order! Excellent service by Flipkart! The earphone is awsome! the Bass and treble is as perfect to hear! If your device has Dolby Atmos or any sound enhancements them the sound is as perfect as a nature sound. Wire is enogh long. Pros: 1. The sound is excellent. 2. wire is enough long. 3. 3.5mm jack makes it good fr any smartphone. 4. It also has mic. 5. It has an premium look. Cons: 1. Wire is little bit soft. 2. Ear buds are mat finish.,4
Clarity os good but the bass is low and the treble is high. Wired is comparatively good as per it is not the braided cable.,4
price wise quality good. sound good. Bass is good. Everything about it is good not excellent. wire length is nice not to short nor to long. wire is tangle free. Build quality is good. in ear fit is good. Budget wise one can go for it.,4

I tried to return the product on time, but the guy who came to pick the product did not collect the product saying the wrong return option was selected. Neither the item is being refunded nor the product is replaced. Called several times...every time Flipkart gives a date for resolution. So far nothing happened. Completely a pathetic platform. Flipkart is cheating the customers.",1
Bad quality,2
Don't waste your money,2
Very very lower quality I AM NOT HAPPY Not purchasing friend's,1
Not good enough as even basic things like sound was noisy and more over on one side it stopped working. Only thing people are looking for this product is they are getting 2 headsets for just 200 but it's not worthy for 200rs also,1

"Miniso brings the most out of money. Headphones gives a good quality sound. The bass is not much strong but sounds good.

I don't like earplugs so I never feel like investing in it. For emergency I got it and It looks super cute. I don't know about the quality of the earplugs as today is the first day I am using it.

"Price wise it gets 5 star. Value for money. Sound quality is too 5 star. The only minus point is that its range is very less. It is around 12 feet if there is no hindrance. If you go to another room, or the phone is not visible, it doesn't work even after 10 feet. Contrary to practice, the volume buttons are in reverse order. The upper button decreases the volume whereas the down button increases the volume of the sound.  Purchase only if you want your apparatus to be in the same room otherwi... READ MORE",4

The earphones are good quality and bass is good too but for my taste as I don't like bass much and prefer a clearer sound over bass these aren't worth it as even on 70% bass is high and sound gets distorted can't listen to lyrics bass is always annoying but that's personal choice if ur a bass lover go for it otherwise look for other,4
"Removing 1 star for design otherwise this is best in ear headsets. Sound quality is great. Bass is punchy. Crispy Treble Vocals sound clear. Fits really well inside ears no pain. MIC response is ok. I'm enjoying listening music through these. But nothing is perfect in this world. So, below is the reason I took off 1 star. It's all about design. The MIC is at the joint where left and right cables split which makes the voice coming from far. So while on call or using Voice assistant, spea... READ MORE",4

"1.Build quality is very good in this price, it's feel premium.üëç 2.Battey backup is also very good you can play for 8-10 hours.üëç 3.TypeC charging Port.üëç 4.Proper bass and treble üëç.Best handsfree for music lovers. 4.No vibration alert during incoming calls üëé 5.Not good for PUBG lovers üëé voice lagging is a big issue. 6.Voice over calls just ok.üëé 7.voice recording also oküëé. 8.Earphore cable is so thin,you have to handle carefully.üëé  Overall Good product at this price.üëç",4
My honest review. Upside:- 1. Bass and sound is superb at this price.. 2. Battery back up and look is also amazing. 3. Clear song sound. 4. Strong Magnetic stick. 5. One year warranty. 6. For normal talk with normal voice its ok and clear  Downside:- 4. Bluetooth connection range is not more than 5 metre 5. Long wire.. So be extra careful not to get broken. 6. Mic doesn't capture clearly your when you speak faintly. So the listener faces issue and will ask you to repeat.,4
Very Good Product for music lover..... But For gaming person it is not so good.,4
Length is so high . If this length reduced . Perfect neckband at this price,5
"Sound is loud and clear and bass is just awesome. Battery backup is around 8-9 Hours. Cable length is longer than normal. It's around 26CM. Magnet in not that much strong. Bluetooth Range is not 10 metres, it will disconnect if you went to another room or more than 5-6 metres. Thers is some latency in audio, so don't consider it for gaming.",4
"Base Good, nice earphones, cable more flexibility it's not good",5
Excellent product,5
Wow ü•∫,5

"These are the best earbuds i ever tried in this budget segment this earbuds are value money  If you love to listen songs with high amount of bass this is the perfect one to buy, battery backup is awesome  You will never get this kind of a decent charging dock in this price segment it has a matte finish and scratches are not easily gonna come  In this price segment no headphones have this much of decent charging case and and with awesome earbuds that give deep bass and awesome sound quality",5
It's as good as its name . It has very good quality of sound . It's best for those who love to listen songs. The earpods have high base,5

Nice product but zebronics india should be focus on only one problem regarding their product there are the voice breaking soo much in ear buds.,5
Sound quality A1  Product A1  Light weight  Mind-blowing products,5
Verry verry good sounds I'm so happy,5
"Clear, standard quality sound... ‚ù§ Although the base is slightly low, but enough to satisfy your needs... Highly recommend for professional also... one more if anyone loves listening classical music such as various indian ragas, go for it! trust me the sound of tabla (base) is heavenly..  like it, if i help u little bit :')",5
"Having both pros & cons #Pros : 1. Light weight. 2. Good sound with extra bass. 3. Ear cups aren't huge, therefore ears won't get heated. 4. Mic is another plus point in this range. #Cons : 1. After a long time extra bass is annoying. 2. Soundproof is not good. ( Anybody with bare ears closer to the person with headphone can easily hear what's playing )",4
This is a awesome product. I got it in right time. And everything is good as well..the sound quality is extremely clear and if u listen in full sound then u will get deaf nearly..that the sound is so high. The best thing is that it's look and sound adjustability. I will prefer u blindly go for it.And I m giving this review after 4 months of daily use and its same as before. Thanks flipkart. üôÇ,5
Nice quality.... its original SONY product And its pros are crystal clear audio and average bass. And the cons i found was that its one side becomes louder than other sometimes and also cause variation when plugged in high volt devices like computer and low volt devices like smartphone and mp3.And it was little bit smaller in size than i expected. All Over Its best budget earphone..and GO FOR IT!!!,5
"Okay, So you're probably confused on buying these or not. If you're comparing these with the Moto Pulse 2 and Pulse Max, Then you need to read on. Okay so almost after 2 days of torturing tough usage, I came up with these points. ---Pros--- 1.Good Balance between treble and bass 2.Comfortable padding, covers the ears almost completely, as these are on the ear headphones instead of over the ear ones. 3. Really good quality microphone, extremely sensitive, but smartly cuts out excessive noise.... READ MORE",4

"I literally don't like the packaging though the design of the headphone is elegant.. I bought it during the sale ... sound quality is good but obviously not the best bass is okay , I like though but sound proofing is not good....",3
Dark Side : 1. Sound does not converge well when in a very busy market place. 2. Does not produce very loud sound as people may like when they see any product related to sound.  Bright Side : 1. Excellent build quality. Super finish as expected from Sony. Portable design. 2. Does not pain ears at all even after using for hours continuously. But at some point it may pain. I suggest removing the device for 5 minutes when it pains. 3. Sound is brilliant considering people are not wild. Good bas... READ MORE,5

Really awesome headset product √ë√≠√ß√©,4
"Angled jack would have been better. Audio quality is good. Mic is working fine. I bought these as to attend long meeting sessions as i don't feel comfortable with the model having silicone buds.  If you are okay with silicone buds then go for Bassheadset 103. Its audio quality is better than Basshead 104. I also have 103 model with me.  Do not expect lot of bass in these two models, bass effect is very little. If you are not a bass lover, model 103 would suit you well.",4

Not that good but below average as battery backup not so good further when you talk other person cannot hear properly they always say your voice is very low means we have to speak load so other person can hear properly hence talking is not good hence according to me one should not go for this just because of less price quality issue is there,2

Using this for past two days and Iam really impressed with the sound clarity. I did not expect the bass to be as good as this. Call clarity is great. Only problem I faced is connectivity.

This review is written after 1 month use: The main thing i would like to highlight is that the fast charging option is a saviour here. 5 minutes charge will give you 1 hour backup and total battery life is 6 hours .

Review after one week of usage . I am getting a battery backup of 7-8hours a day. Bass is not that much good but still its nice. Only you have to do is adjust the equilizer in your phone for better bass and quality sound. It has a good latency and best for gaming like Pubg. I was about to buy oneplus bulletz but it has a lower bass than 255pro. Charge for atleast 1.5 to 2 hours after delivery for the first time for best battery backup.,5
i was actually very happy with this product of boat till the day it stopped working and i don't have any clue about that. It worked pretty well for 2 months and o dont know what went wrong i plucked in the charger and multicolored light start blinkiy and after that my it not switching on. i tried draining the battery but still doesy switch on. Only when i plug in the charger the light would blink and nothing else,1

Clarity os good but the bass is low and the treble is high. Wired is comparatively good as per it is not the braided cable.,4
price wise quality good. sound good. Bass is good. Everything about it is good not excellent. wire length is nice not to short nor to long. wire is tangle free. Build quality is good. in ear fit is good. Budget wise one can go for it.,4

YouTube reviews are showing it was a better product in the range . But unfortunately I was bought this headphone . It was not a better a product . Just like a ok product only . Don't fooliesh the people . The bass is average only .and voice clarity also not well. When we compare to realme buds 2 ... Realme buds 2 is always ultimate . So don't buy this headphone . Please go with realme buds 2 .....,2

"I'm a professional musician since the last 14 years and you can trust me when i say that this is one of the best budget earphones when you talk about the ones with microphone.

And the microphone is also of good quality.",5

In one word the product is just excellent. I got this for just Rs.599. Sony never disappoints anyone in case of audio instruments and did the same here again.

Great quality material. Do have noise cancellation too. Better comfort and battery backup than previous model(400). The design is very appealing. Both quality and look is amazing in this range. Using it from 3 weeks and no complaints till now. Aux quality could have been better if braided one would have been used. But still ok. Overall 9.5/10.,5

You won't even feel that there is something disturbing in your ears.  Only reason for reducing 1 star is the control. Some basic functions such as double click for l... READ MORE,4
"After a lot of research under the 2000 price bracket, I decided to go for these. The dilemma was only between the one plus bullets wireless z bass edition vs oppo enco m31. If anyone is facing the same dilemma, here's is a small tip to decide which one to buy: If you love music, go for oppo, you won't be disappointed. I have compared them with the regular apple earphones(which come in the box) as I really like their sound quality and oppo sound even somewhat better than those. Trebles and voc... READ MORE",5
"CAUTION: BASSHEADS STAY AWAY FROM THIS. Awesome headset under 2000. Elaborating in detail- 1. Sound quality- it's all about sound clarity , the vocals are crystal clear , trebles are hitting right and bass in balanced mode is in the apt amount and you won't find that excessive bass ,in bass mode it enhances the bass but the mid tones and high tones will be compromised. Sound stage is wide and instrument separation is awesome and details in sound is top notch. As per my opinion those who like ... READ MORE",5
Very satisfied with this product. 1.sound quality is awesome Ldac done the job. 2.bass is good.but I preferred balanced mode most of the time. 3.build quality is decent 4.i like it is water proof. If you love my review.like me to know.,4
Updating my review after 5 months .  Headphones stop working one side earpiece not working quality wise its not good as compared other boat headphone.

"Mini Bass Bomb!!! VFM. For the Most important thing regarding this product and others as well go directly to the end of the review.  Here's in a nutshell what I feel after using these earphones:- It's a Bass Bomb. Headphones used by me earlier are Sony MDR XB 150AP, Sennheiser CX 180, JBL BT160, Boat 225 and my most premium till date Sony MDR-XB900 which costed a bomb at around ‚Çπ 7000.

The bass production and the sound quality is just perfect on my realme 2 pro didn't expected this type of quality. the audio is crystal clear treble is good enough and vocals are awesome,5
"AWESOME...... This one word describes these bass heads 182 by BOAT. The braided cable prevents headset from getting highly tangled, there is mic with button to receive and disconnect calls, the specifically angled jack makes it easy to connect with mobile, PC as well as laptop. But the main thing which is centre of attraction is the sound quality, the BASS HEADS live upto their name, and the sound is crisp even at high volume levels.",5
Awesome Product...!!! This is the best boAt earphone. ‚úìThe sound is very clear. ‚úìDesign looks very good. ‚úìFit in ears. ‚úìFeels good while listening songs. ‚úìIt maintains the bass in such a way so that it would not affect our ears. ‚úìWire is very Strong. ‚úìMic records voice very clearly. √ó Left and Right earphones not works correctly.  *** If you are a music lover then go for it.***,5
Best Earphones ever ..... The sound is crystal clear and a good gaming earphones too ..... I would suggest to buy these ..... These are totally Bass Heads ...,5
PROS: Bass is heavy Ear buds are light ..can use for long periods Wire is long enough and strong. Sound output is too loud...u can't listen at full volume even for a minute. Looks good  CONS: The only con i have found is..' treble '.All they have focused on is bass...treble is very less..  Overall if you are a bass lover like me ... go for it..u will not regret for sure.,5
Sound quality is good but looks a bit cheap and price should b 350 to 400 i don't like an angled hands-free that why i ordered for this if u like angled one than a bit cheap option in boat of 399rs is also available and boat is a brand and giving 1 year warranty so surely it is worth buying i m using Realme 2 pro and sound quality is very good with this device if price is good according to you than surely go for it.,4
I like it because it was so smooth it was very good quality the base was very very good,5
nice built quality... looks good.. i love red one. Sound and bass is good enough. Voice is going clear without noise to other side on call. all over good product from boat.,4

The best thing happened to me is that I own this beauty now . Being a music addict (and a gadget freak too) I've tried almost all the budget headphones .. but JBL delivers what it promise. I would highly recommend it to someone who is into music badly .

"Just one thing to say is how it is possible to get this good and premium quality earphones at this cheap price ?  - The first best thing is the sound it is amazing and crisp, bass lovers are just going to love it and others will also enjoy the amazing sound this earphones produce.

"Was one of the first buyers to get this earphone, had no review written and pictures posted so I took a shot. If you love punchy bass this is not for you. It does has bass but the appropriate amount only. People like me who loves to hear the vocals or acoustic music would love this headset. The cable is braided but not by kevlar but by some sort of hard plastic and that will definitely add a rigid touch to the wire. Does have microphone but that is made out of hard plastic, one single button ... READ MORE",5

These are better than BOAT 200/220/225.  Bass is low but sound clarity is good. Sound is inferior to House of Marley smile Jamaica earphones(‚Çπ900-‚Çπ1000)  The wire is strong and rigid. Oakwood drums are well built.  Looks stylish and performs well.,4
Before this I was using jbl C100SI... Trebble was good and bass was okay... However if I compare this product with JBL on below points  1) Price: In this price range no other company can beat this product  2). Design: Again no match (what a wonderful design). It is a wonderful carved wooden and metallic drum.  3) Bass/Sound: Louder and bassy than JBL. However at low volume JBL perform beats were more clearer,5

"Hey Guys,,,,,, if u loves balanced sound signature then it's Really satisfied you. But if you are a basshead type person then Go for Others. Build quality, microphone,connectivity and battery life is really good. But at this price point other brands gives you more features and better Neckband design. I gave 4 stars because I loves balanced sound signature.",4
Loving the sound on these and ease of use. Bass is punchy and full and overall sound is awesome without affecting clarity and vocals. Excellent battery life as well.,5
"Awesome JBL sound! After trying a lot of other headphones, I can say JBL stands it's ground. Class apart sound, specially for bass lovers without comprising on clarity. Easy to use for calls and casual workouts as well. Magnetic buds is a very useful feature.",5
I am happy with JBL Tune 125BT It is very good while having calls and has very good battery backup.,5
"Trust me it has very clear & thumping bass, even in full volume the bass is not distorted. Many people review this that it has no bass, so I told you please plug the ear tips in your ear tightly to make it air tight, then you feel the bass, and trust me friends its sounds very good, every pitch of sound is Cristal clear and balanced even in full volume.",5
"Amazing sound quality, it‚Äôs best for people who like balanced and rich sound quality. Bass is ample and balanced, not over which makes sound quality and music experience very fantastic. Practically Battery backup is just near as mentioned, get around 14-15 hours of battery life at 60-70% volume. Amazing product and delivers quality sound and music experience",5

I bought this product and used it like for 3 months and then the right channel and the mic stopped working.

It is a wonderful product. Manufacturer design is super & smooth also. Looking also very attractive. Sounds quality & microphone is good. In my point of view it is one of the best earphone.,5
Worth buying!! Best product in this price range..!! Sound is acoustic and melodious with equally excellent bass quality!! You'll be blissful to have this in your buds.,5
"They are perfectly balanced in terms of audio(Obviously, JBL!) The thing I liked most is that they are so light weight! Doesn't even feel like anything! Plus, their angled design let's them fit into ear so easily. Absolutely bomb set of earphones for this price range! Totally recommended! ü§©",5

I don't like earplugs so I never feel like investing in it. For emergency I got it and It looks super cute. I don't know about the quality of the earplugs as today is the first day I am using it.

Fitting varies from person to person, For someone its perfect and some finds it not so comfortable. I must say you have to physically try in your ears for satisfaction.

I started using it as soon as I opened the box. The sound quality is really good. Bass is perfect. It is a perfect fit for my ear. Very light weight. Tested it with my Huawei Nova 3i for more than 2 and a half hour of continuous youtube playback. Worked perfectly. The battery icon changed to orange after approx 2 hrs 15 minutes. I guess the battery can last upto 3 hrs. I have no idea about battery backup of other brands. Still my only suggestion is that battery backup can be improved.,5

I have received my buds today and they are working perfectly fine. Sound is good for music and used for couple of office calls. So far I have not faced any issue.

"Here are my thoughts, very in-depth. 1. They're cheap. Real cheap, considering an identical pair of earphones from a certain other brand would run you down 25k.  2. Sound: The second most important thing, after price. They're good. They have somewhat of a V shape sound signature so songs sound 'exiciting'. The bass is thumpy and punchy (I guess that's why they call it bass boost drivers), but the very low end near 80hz just isn't there. I'd expected much lower bass presence considering they h...

"Not worth for money. Don't buy. Not suitable for pubg, free fire,etc...There is no clarity about the footprints. Speekars Are combined.",1
"Just got these. Here's my first impressions. The bass makes it really fun to play games like rocket league. Music is simply amazing on this headset.As for comfort, I'd say is it's pretty good. Better than my previous headset, it's comfortable, but it's not the best. The mic is awesome for this budget. I really needed a new headset and a mic in budget to record videos for my YouTube channel. Overall, it's a really good headset so far. Definitely worth the price if your budget is low and you ne...

The bass production and the sound quality is just perfect on my realme 2 pro didn't expected this type of quality. the audio is crystal clear treble is good enough and vocals are awesome,5
"AWESOME...... This one word describes these bass heads 182 by BOAT. The braided cable prevents headset from getting highly tangled, there is mic with button to receive and disconnect calls, the specifically angled jack makes it easy to connect with mobile, PC as well as laptop. But the main thing which is centre of attraction is the sound quality, the BASS HEADS live upto their name, and the sound is crisp even at high volume levels.",5
Awesome Product...!!! This is the best boAt earphone. ‚úìThe sound is very clear. ‚úìDesign looks very good. ‚úìFit in ears. ‚úìFeels good while listening songs. ‚úìIt maintains the bass in such a way so that it would not affect our ears. ‚úìWire is very Strong. ‚úìMic records voice very clearly. √ó Left and Right earphones not works correctly.  *** If you are a music lover then go for it.***,5
Best Earphones ever ..... The sound is crystal clear and a good gaming earphones too ..... I would suggest to buy these ..... These are totally Bass Heads ...,5
PROS: Bass is heavy Ear buds are light ..can use for long periods Wire is long enough and strong. Sound output is too loud...u can't listen at full volume even for a minute. Looks good  CONS: The only con i have found is..' treble '.All they have focused on is bass...treble is very less..  Overall if you are a bass lover like me ... go for it..u will not regret for sure.,5
Sound quality is good but looks a bit cheap and price should b 350 to 400 i don't like an angled hands-free that why i ordered for this if u like angled one than a bit cheap option in boat of 399rs is also available and boat is a brand and giving 1 year warranty so surely it is worth buying i m using Realme 2 pro and sound quality is very good with this device if price is good according to you than surely go for it.,4
I like it because it was so smooth it was very good quality the base was very very good,5

superb quality would recommend this earphones over Oppo enco M31. oppo enco M31 is giving all features which are most essential sound quality much much better than boat 385v2. LDAC is awesome when it comes to performance. It does beat qualcomm aptx hd quality easily without a sweat. I would recommend any sony LDAC bluetooth earphones which has HIfi logo on its box just go for it. I brought oppo enco m31 returned it because battery back up is of just 2 hours to 3 hours. this is the only reason... READ MORE,5

Review after one week of usage . I am getting a battery backup of 7-8hours a day. Bass is not that much good but still its nice. Only you have to do is adjust the equilizer in your phone for better bass and quality sound. It has a good latency and best for gaming like Pubg. I was about to buy oneplus bulletz but it has a lower bass than 255pro. Charge for atleast 1.5 to 2 hours after delivery for the first time for best battery backup.,5
i was actually very happy with this product of boat till the day it stopped working and i don't have any clue about that.

"Just wish it fits your ear for jogging or running. Other than that everything is perfectly amazing. Connection: connected very easily to my oneplus 8 and laptop. Sound: perfect Noise cancellation: Not the best there is, but it is enough Mic: i really thought this would be bad, since its quite far from the mouth, but there was absolutely no noise(with clear voice) in attending meetings and calls.",3
Just loved the product. Works seamlessly. I wanted it to connect to my laptop to attend meetings. Looks sturdy as I dropped them but they still work. Lol.  Mic quality is great. Delivery was super fast and got it before time on one day.,5
The sound quality was very clear and you can hear all minute sounds while watching hd or 4k content. Bass is adequate and decent level but not that much loud who loves more sound. Comfort level was superb I don't realise after sometime whether something I has in my ear. Fit on ear is very perfect atleast for me and I believe it vary person to person depends on their ear. Overall all good buy for this price.,5
* Fastest Delivery * Perfect Sound Quality * I would like give 4 out of 5 rating for Bass * Earbuds fitting slightly loose for me .But it's depends on the user . * If you are Oneplus user than connectivity is very fast . * For OnePlus User you will get the more functionality with the Touch. * Based on the Price range OnePlus earbuds is worth it .,5
I quite liked the buds. It gives u a balanced experience. Connectivity is good. Sound output is awesome.  The main standout thing is the Nord Blue color.. Its very trendy.üòé,4
Prosüëçüèª 1. Premium built quality 2. Audio quality is good during phone call... It actually reduces background noise and picks up only the voice which is nice. 3. Headphone automatically pauses the song when you take out of the ear which is great as it saves battery. 4. Excellent battery backup and quick charging.  Consüëéüèª 1. Bass is not that great... although you can adjust the Equalizer to get most of it..but without modifying Equalizer it is just in the mid-level. 2. Double tap function i... READ MORE,5
Awesome buds! I'm not happy with 2 points- it's quite big and got irritation to keep that ear for longer time. Could be since it is new.. Need few days to get used to it! Battery.. not that great I believe.. Should wait n watch . Works smoothly with OnePlus mobiles.,3

Easy to connect, once you open the bud it gets automatically connected within 3-4 secs.",4
Very good product. Nice experience... Good quality with high bass and effective sound.,5

"Sound quality, bass and battery backup much better than Oneplus bullets wireless Z thanks to Aptx HD support.  Have used for a week now and am amazed by the performance of the product. I wonder why people flock to chinese oneplus z in such huge numbers when this Indian company product is obviously better.  Aptx HD is automatically set in my Poco f1 when I pair with the product.  Have used the buds for about 8hrs 2 days ago, today for 1 hr and still the battery is at 60%. Just great",5
Very nice product battery life is a 29 hours 73. minutes . This product is a very good full song full bass and full battery backup my first bluetooth earphone is a JBL 160 this is a not good I am like to boat rockerz 335 full . Investment Yuva no doubt this product I am a I am a very happy thank you Flipkart thank you thank u boat rockerz,5
Super bass and sound quality are amazing total overall performance is 10/ 10 I really love it battary performance 25 hour and build quality super so this better than Sony 310 and oneplus bullet bass edition Realme wireless pro,5
"Great quality Audio. AptX HD does make a difference in the audio quality. Charging is fast. Gets from 0 to full in about 40 minutes. Battery life is not 30 hours. It is around 15 to 20 hours if you are an enthusiast like me and like to keep your volume atleast above 60%. The headset is flexible and it gives a solid feel. Overall I recommend this over Bullets Wireless Z as it sounds better, offers a little more battery life and has AptX HD.",4
This yellow combination is so good and believe me or not its worth of your money metal build body so build quality is awesome far better than Samsung level U 2 eirbuds are greatly adjust in ear  battery backup is very good I have played the newly brought product for hours but still not shut down  bass is awesome better than Jbl or any other product  and the ware is so thick from me 9.5 out of 10 overall,5

Great Product from BoAt Actually I have not reviewed any products for past few years. But reviewing this product since this is so good for the price we pay. Using this for past two days and Iam really impressed with the sound clarity. I did not expect the bass to be as good as this. Call clarity is great. Only problem I faced is connectivity. It takes some time to connect to the right ear bud. Overall looks like a great product from BoAt.üòçüòç,5
"Reviewing after using 3 days.  Sound : So I'm going to tell you in sort and Simple, you'll not get better then this. I've tried JBL, Realme, Apple but they are not for music lovers Maybe they are good for calling.  Design : The only resign of deduction of 1 star. It was somewhat bulky and hevyier. In jeans pocket it was look like a stone.  Battery : You'll be impressed by the battery backup, case has 500mAh battery.

"Hey Guys,,,,,, if u loves balanced sound signature then it's Really satisfied you. But if you are a basshead type person then Go for Others. Build quality, microphone,connectivity and battery life is really good. But at this price point other brands gives you more features and better Neckband design. I gave 4 stars because I loves balanced sound signature.",4
Loving the sound on these and ease of use. Bass is punchy and full and overall sound is awesome without affecting clarity and vocals. Excellent battery life as well.,5
"Awesome JBL sound! After trying a lot of other headphones, I can say JBL stands it's ground. Class apart sound, specially for bass lovers without comprising on clarity. Easy to use for calls and casual workouts as well. Magnetic buds is a very useful feature.",5
I am happy with JBL Tune 125BT It is very good while having calls and has very good battery backup.,5
"Trust me it has very clear & thumping bass, even in full volume the bass is not distorted. Many people review this that it has no bass, so I told you please plug the ear tips in your ear tightly to make it air tight, then you feel the bass, and trust me friends its sounds very good, every pitch of sound is Cristal clear and balanced even in full volume.",5
"Amazing sound quality, it‚Äôs best for people who like balanced and rich sound quality. Bass is ample and balanced, not over which makes sound quality and music experience very fantastic. Practically Battery backup is just near as mentioned, get around 14-15 hours of battery life at 60-70% volume. Amazing product and delivers quality sound and music experience",5
Super batery backup and nice clear sound.. It wil be Worth the investment,5
JBL Tune125BT is a very good product Very happy with sound quality of 125BT.It has a good bass for music and also a good voice clarity for calls,5

"First i got this product with seal open before opening ....so i doubted that , and i found one side of the headphone is not working....so i requested for a replacement and now this time the headphone is working perfectly fine...cal quality is awesome ....high tones are not that good as expected after using boat earphones but satisfying for this proce range",5
It's a good headphone. Sound quality is amazing for the price but it's not durable . Within one year of moderate use the leather starting wearing off and the earcups are completely gone. And now even the sound quality has become terrible. They should at least offer one extra pair of earcups.,4
"My hunt for a nice headset ended with Boat Rockerz...looks absolutely premium with leather finish ear cushions and the head band. Buttons are very responsive and the overall feel of these speakers is really good.

These are one of the best earphones in this price range . The design and build quality of the product is very very good . The build is sturdy and strong . The bass has very great thumping effect and the high and lows are on point so don't worry about the voice clarity.,5
A great earphones in such a price range. Can feel the bass boost by its amazing drivers...its just a little loud even in the medium levels of volume..so listening in higher volume is out of question...but overall a good build quality and sturdy product..loved it...,5

after 1 month of purchase mic stopped working! isn't this a good product. Thank you JBL for perfectly fooling the customers and to make sure they have no hopes on your brand.,1

It is a wonderful product. Manufacturer design is super & smooth also. Looking also very attractive. Sounds quality & microphone is good. In my point of view it is one of the best earphone.,5
Worth buying!! Best product in this price range..!! Sound is acoustic and melodious with equally excellent bass quality!! You'll be blissful to have this in your buds.,5
"They are perfectly balanced in terms of audio(Obviously, JBL!) The thing I liked most is that they are so light weight! Doesn't even feel like anything! Plus, their angled design let's them fit into ear so easily. Absolutely bomb set of earphones for this price range! Totally recommended! ü§©",5

Tested it with my Huawei Nova 3i for more than 2 and a half hour of continuous youtube playback. Worked perfectly. The battery icon changed to orange after approx 2 hrs 15 minutes. I guess the battery can last upto 3 hrs. I have no idea about battery backup of other brands. Still my only suggestion is that battery backup can be improved.,5
"Nice product at this price point. Advantages: 1. Automatically connects upon opening flap of pods ; after initial connection through Bluetooth search option 2. Pod carries additional power bank for the buds 3. Very light weight, approx 4-5 GM make it super usable 4. Gesture details: 1. It is double tap to play or pause 2. Triple tap to next song 3. Long tap for voice assistant 4. long tap on both side for gaming mode to reduce latency Disadvantages : 1. In bone sensing for music play/pause/d... READ MORE",3
I have received my buds today and they are working perfectly fine. Sound is good for music and used for couple of office calls. So far I have not faced any issue. Touch are sensitive so please use them carefully. Beautifully designed and enjoying it. Read the manual carefully otherwise you may face issue with ear buds sounds like others.,5
"Here are my thoughts, very in-depth. 1. They're cheap. Real cheap, considering an identical pair of earphones from a certain other brand would run you down 25k.  2. Sound: The second most important thing, after price. They're good. They have somewhat of a V shape sound signature so songs sound 'exiciting'. The bass is thumpy and punchy (I guess that's why they call it bass boost drivers), but the very low end near 80hz just isn't there. I'd expected much lower bass presence considering they h...

well the headphone is pretty good; the built and design is very good and comfortable. Every day i use it 6 7 hours and i feel no pain on my ear which mostly happens with any other headphone cause its circumference is much big and covers my whole ear. In terms of sounds it is not that good(not too loud) but better than earphones and have a little bass. Overall it is a comfortable and stylish headphone with a affordable price. ‚ù§‚ù§,4

Good sound good mic. Depends on ur head. Will the headphones be comfortable. Meant for a big heads earpadds size is big. Some might find it uncomfortable. Again it all depends on ur head size. That's the only con. Which depends on ur comfort level. Rest the headphones are very good. Only time will tell how long they last. Fingers crossed that it lasts Coz it's a gr8 deal. And the led lights make it look very cool.,5
"This is very good product. Mic is the specialty of this headphone. But as previous reviews ,sound quality is not so effective as I expected compared to price but it feels like a surround sound. Materials are very good. With the led lights it becomes more cool for live gaming on YouTube.",5

after 1 month of purchase mic stopped working! isn't this a good product. Thank you JBL for perfectly fooling the customers and to make sure they have no hopes on your brand.,1
"The headset is mostly good and the build quality I would say good ,the 'L' shaped pin helps in long lasting Built. The package also has extra pair of buds. The ear bud is a bit angled. The delivery is faster than I expected.",4
It is a wonderful product. Manufacturer design is super & smooth also. Looking also very attractive. Sounds quality & microphone is good. In my point of view it is one of the best earphone.,5
Worth buying!! Best product in this price range..!! Sound is acoustic and melodious with equally excellent bass quality!! You'll be blissful to have this in your buds.,5
"They are perfectly balanced in terms of audio(Obviously, JBL!) The thing I liked most is that they are so light weight! Doesn't even feel like anything! Plus, their angled design let's them fit into ear so easily. Absolutely bomb set of earphones for this price range! Totally recommended! ü§©",5

"This is one good headphone with decent sound i will not say that it the most good sounding earphone available, but it is absolutely worth the money you pay. Talking about the built quality it is good for this price, whan it comes to sound quality it has a mild mid and treble and the bass is so smooth. If you are a bass lover it is the one for you, but if you are a good listener of songs better is to look for some other models",4

All them then lacking that extra vocal effect to feel music Boult truebuds provide it efficiently Connectivity is mindblowing Yes i agree with low bass But it's adequate enough Not that thumpy bass And for better quality i use wavelet application along with it   Sum up in a line: Just go for it If you are audiophile",5

Best in his class as expected from Boult. This is my second bluetooth purchase of Boult and I am very happy and satisfied with it's performance. Battery backup is very good. It is little beat heavy and large you cannot use it for long time because it heart's in ear after few hours. Automatic paired as you brought it from charging box. Also no option of switch off. When you don't want to use just put it inside charging box. Sound is good.,4
Pros:-1. Very good connectivity. 2.paires very fast less than 5 sec 3.good sound quality 4.good call quality 5. Mono mode works superb 6. great battery backup Cons:-1.not comfortable for long use,4

"AWESOME...... This one word describes these bass heads 182 by BOAT. The braided cable prevents headset from getting highly tangled, there is mic with button to receive and disconnect calls, the specifically angled jack makes it easy to connect with mobile, PC as well as laptop. But the main thing which is centre of attraction is the sound quality, the BASS HEADS live upto their name, and the sound is crisp even at high volume levels.",5
Awesome Product...!!! This is the best boAt earphone. ‚úìThe sound is very clear. ‚úìDesign looks very good. ‚úìFit in ears. ‚úìFeels good while listening songs. ‚úìIt maintains the bass in such a way so that it would not affect our ears. ‚úìWire is very Strong. ‚úìMic records voice very clearly. √ó Left and Right earphones not works correctly.  *** If you are a music lover then go for it.***,5
Best Earphones ever ..... The sound is crystal clear and a good gaming earphones too ..... I would suggest to buy these ..... These are totally Bass Heads ...,5
PROS: Bass is heavy Ear buds are light ..can use for long periods Wire is long enough and strong. Sound output is too loud...u can't listen at full volume even for a minute. Looks good  CONS: The only con i have found is..' treble '.All they have focused on is bass...treble is very less..  Overall if you are a bass lover like me ... go for it..u will not regret for sure.,5
Sound quality is good but looks a bit cheap and price should b 350 to 400 i don't like an angled hands-free that why i ordered for this if u like angled one than a bit cheap option in boat of 399rs is also available and boat is a brand and giving 1 year warranty so surely it is worth buying i m using Realme 2 pro and sound quality is very good with this device if price is good according to you than surely go for it.,4
I like it because it was so smooth it was very good quality the base was very very good,5

Its awesome sound and bass. The connectivity was very quick and easy. The design was very nice and i love it very much. Thanks for the flipkart.,4
"Value for money giving four start rating as it is good for listening music and watching movies but during calls and gaming it dosent work properly, call gets interrupted when speaking on WhatsApp call and if phone call is ringing on the same time, no neither of the calls can be handled when using this Bluetooth headphones. One can go for these who loves music and watching movies :)",4
One of the best air pods worth buying it....many people writing that it's not good for calling but I found it all awsome in all aspects.....go for it,5
Good Sound Quality with super battery backup. Plus it is lightweight which makes it very portable. Very easy to pair and connect as well. Definitely recommend this.,5
I loved the performance of the product. It was comfortable to wear and easy to access. When it comes out of the charging box it automatically gets connected to the bluetooth with the lastly paired device.It was a wonderful experience using it. Product has nice grip so that it won't fall off.Its sound is amazing and clear. Nice battery back can use for a long time for whatsoever work may be. Nice was quite appreciable. Can buy this good product.üëç,5
Realitive better earpods . lovely voice and better battery backup then other and must say it is worth to The price....,5
Sounds a good product after using it for a week..one thing missing is a charge percentage indicator in the storage box. I recently bought boat airdopes which had a led indicator to show the battery percentage...but I really like the clip model which holds well around the ears,4
Very good sound quality and Bass. Battery backup is also good with decent build quality. The design is in such a way that buds will not fall down accidentally. Mic quality is little downside...some times the other person is not able to clearly hear our voice but it's not too bad. It's obvious since the mic is on our ear and not close to mouth. A really good option in this price range. Got this for 1199 during offer period.,5
Nice product.,5

"One of the best product in this price range. Best for calling purpose. After using for few days, i can say that battery backup is also better than other wireless air pods in this price range. Really satisfied with the product. Sound quality is also marvellous.",5
I bought this for calling and music... For music and bass wise this is awesome but when we talk about calling experience is worst. In silent room also another person hear lots of noise like we were sitting in Bus. Based on reviews i bought two sets and now I'm regretting my decision.,1
"Its Perfect Ear buds for Regular Use or in Gym , Its Very nice Disign and Comfortable Fitting in the Ear. So i will Suggest to Every one !",5
Very nice earbuds. Nice voice quality while calling as well. Good to buy. Just a point to note the box is so smooth and plain that sometimes it slips from hand üòÜ,5

Very good for long time use Very good for calling Very comfortable in ears Very good battery backup Built quality very good  Bass average Sound good Battery very good Value for money Buy if you want to use for long time for calling and meeting Music playback is good not best,5
The best product for those who prefer half ear designed earphones. Because it is not comfortable for long time. But after this... everything is great...Love this product üòçüòç,5

"I'm giving 2 star because sound quality is not good it sounds like a rs. 60/- earphones which is available on local market, didn't expect this from boat. Bass is too much. Having full bass don't make it premium product. Secondly noise cancellation is not proper. Overall not satisfactory. Look wise it's awesome and battery backup is good plus connectivity is superb.",2

Comfortable - yes absolutely comfortable, wore them straight for 6 hours and didn't feel uncomfortable for a second. 4. Flip to mute works perfectly. 5.

"Hey Guys,,,,,, if u loves balanced sound signature then it's Really satisfied you. But if you are a basshead type person then Go for Others. Build quality, microphone,connectivity and battery life is really good. But at this price point other brands gives you more features and better Neckband design. I gave 4 stars because I loves balanced sound signature.",4
Loving the sound on these and ease of use. Bass is punchy and full and overall sound is awesome without affecting clarity and vocals. Excellent battery life as well.,5
"Awesome JBL sound! After trying a lot of other headphones, I can say JBL stands it's ground. Class apart sound, specially for bass lovers without comprising on clarity. Easy to use for calls and casual workouts as well. Magnetic buds is a very useful feature.",5
I am happy with JBL Tune 125BT It is very good while having calls and has very good battery backup.,5
"Trust me it has very clear & thumping bass, even in full volume the bass is not distorted. Many people review this that it has no bass, so I told you please plug the ear tips in your ear tightly to make it air tight, then you feel the bass, and trust me friends its sounds very good, every pitch of sound is Cristal clear and balanced even in full volume.",5
"Amazing sound quality, it‚Äôs best for people who like balanced and rich sound quality. Bass is ample and balanced, not over which makes sound quality and music experience very fantastic. Practically Battery backup is just near as mentioned, get around 14-15 hours of battery life at 60-70% volume. Amazing product and delivers quality sound and music experience",5
Super batery backup and nice clear sound.. It wil be Worth the investment,5
JBL Tune125BT is a very good product Very happy with sound quality of 125BT.It has a good bass for music and also a good voice clarity for calls,5

I bought and use for 2 days...... it's were fully not worked,1
Nice product but design was bad and no volum up and down buttons,3
Completely satisfying purchase. Great sound even at full volume. Magical battery performance lasting 22hrs. I charge it like twice a week max.,5
Overall the earphones are good. Giving a good battery backup upto more than 15 hours all the times as I'm using it for the past two weeks. As a Sony product the sound quality is awesome. Don't expect too much bass like the alternatives skullcandy and jbl. But it's cool though. Build quality is with plastic. Design is also good but they can improve. The pricing is okay while comparing with other brands. Really a good choice for travellers as it is giving nice battery backups.,4
I THINK SONY IS THE BEST OF BEST .. IT IS GOOD IN QUALITY... SOUND QUALITY WAS AMAZING ... AND BATTERY BACKUP IS TO GOOD I LV IT ..... THANK U SONY AND FLIPKART.... I M FULLY SATISFYING WITH THIS PRODUCTS,5
"what a headphone. I have used lots of them till now, but don't is the best in class. if they make it, they make it good.  Pros-. 1) best in class sound clarity. 2) Exact amount of Bass what u actually need. 3) NFC works like a cream, smooth and sober. 4) Bestest battery back up till now...  Cons-. Could have been better in the material used, but negligible...   Best buy in the price...",5

Many of you thinking what about the bass! You may got so many reviews on flipkart claims that it‚Äôs comes with great bass or you will get a decent amount of bass!

I was for one super surprised it got delivered in one day and love the color. The feature is great and the quality is awesome and sturdy. The sound quality when playing music is great and has really good noise cancellation. The only not so good is when taking a call the voice. The level drops but otherwise really in love.,5
before i used skullcandy.. now i compared sony c400 it's much better than skullcandy.. awesome product really i love it.... good quality awesome sound effects,5
Gives good amount of base but not as much but is really comfortable! The sound is not flat like the JBL T205BT and is very clear. Perfect for gaming. Build quality solid and feels really sturdy on your head. For 2499/- Its worth it! Even if you are into streaming this one is enough.,5
"I was amazed by the headphone's performance. It's a perfect one for gaming. It has a good sound signature range. I play warzone which has lot of sounds happening. This headset balances everything. I could hear footsteps very precisely. The spatial sound feature with windows 10 and xbox one is amazing.  Overall it has a deep bass, good mids and clean highs. If you are a looking gaming headset around 3k go for this.",5
"It's gaming headphones, you should not be expecting really good highs or really good bass. Tbh bass is like minimal. But really good sound, nice fit on the head, really loud and the mic is amazing. So overall they're a really good pair of headphones, but if your intentions are for listening to music, then probably go for the JBL T460 or T500",4
"Using for just one day. Pros: Rugged design, over the ear, flexible, detachable and sensitive mic near the mouth. Cancels almost all surrounding noise, comfortable head pad and good quality ear cushion. Tight fit. Cons: Very difficult to use during summer, perspiration starts around the ears, one might want to take a break while using to get some air. Cable is not very long and doesn't appear sturdy.",4
I have used this for 3 weeks now! The headphones are great for gaming. You can hear every footstep (even the slightest ones). They are a great gaming headsets no doubt about that! With that said they sound good while listening to music as well. They are not great music headphones or anything but being a JBL headphone they do sound really nice! Don't expect any boomy bass or anything but just sound is good and enjoyable! You will have a great time with this headphone! So that's all the good! B... READ MORE,3

The first thing you have to keep in mind that it‚Äôs meant for gaming and it‚Äôs the entry level good quality gaming headphone. I‚Äôm into lot of headphones and speakers. I have observed the quality of JBL - Harman products.  Coming to the point. I‚Äôm using it on my PS4 and it‚Äôs working as expected. Sound level is not that much great as I have also used other headphones so level was same. Mic works fine and yes you can hear every sound very clear.

"Pros: 1) Overear - can wear for long 2) 3.5mm Jack 3) mic is separable , can listen if not required to speak 4) ear cups are smooth, even the head rest part is also smooth  cons: 1) No Nise cancellation 2) mic is not good 3) length of cable 1m around 4) mic is on left side, so if your mic point is on right of lap then wire will cross your keyboard 5) Design wise if you put your left cup to right then you can not use mic as mic would be towards back of the neck",2
Very good product. Decent bass and good loudness. Good thing is the cup fit covering full ears. White colour is attractive. Detachable mike is good add on,5
Really comfortable to wear. Audio quality is decent.,5

I have been using this since 2 days and the battery is damn good and as it is mentioned that it has battery life of 12 hours it is up to its promise the bass and sound quality of this product is awesome in this price range and if u take my opinion it is more better than one plus bullets and plus point is it is made in india in short this product is chhota packet bada dhamaka,5
"One of the best product this price range, 13 hours + play time , good sounds quality , good balance bass , Looking very nice and build quality is ok . Must buy this product . I am ratings 5 ***** .",5
Highly recommend for those who wants a best bluetooth earphones in budget. Seriously guyz its stand value for money. Sound and bass is fantastic as well noice cancelation is good and most important battery backup is impressive. Go for it now.,5
"This is the nice product..The overall sound is good but not extreme..but when we compare this to ""Boat rockerz 255 audio pro bass""..so it is much better than that..and the battery life is too good at about 9-10 hours..and overall the is very good..",4
"Product is Good. But I got product name ""BOUTL"" written on it. I think this is a duplicate product not belong to company and does not has worth of Rs. 1199/- I request flipkart for exchange, again got similar product written ""BOUTL"" written on it. You can purchase local -product around Rs. 300 to 400. While riding bikes, your voice is not clearly audible to the person you are calling. Battery backup is good.

1. Build Quality is very good at this price. Braided long cables and snug fit ear buds dont hurt your ears. Very Light weight. I also used Boult Audio x1 earphone and its really heavy as its metal build. 2. Awssum quality sound. And a balance of treble and bass. Even more clear bass than Boat Bass Heads 103. 3. Easy 1 yr warranty claim on whatsapp. Just click photo of invoice and whatsapp them and voila they immediately replied you with the warranty cover. 4. Flipkart delivery is sharp. Deliv... READ MORE,5
It's a amazing experience from this mivi headphone. Very nice. Very good bass delivered by the headphone. Thank u flipkart as well as mivi.,5
"Sound quality is great but i would not prefer listening at full volume as it gets a little distorted at full. I would prefer keeping at maximum 80% to get best audio and bass experience. It is super comfortable, probably the best at that in this range. You can listen for hours and not feel fatigue which i liked. Quality of cable is good, it is braided one and of good material.",5
"Not much good in this price, you get better options in this price. Go for Jbl or Boat brand they provide much better quality",5

Great experience üëçüëå. Very good quality. Value for money. Definitely buy it without any doubt. BTW the white color is my favorite. Thanks to MIVI.,5
Quality is good but the bass is not up to the mark. But the main problem is the colour is quite different than it appears in the image. But still it's good. Tangle free. Good sound clarity.,5
Good product MIVI,3
Its mic not a good for its mic is dificult,1
"All good, however I required it for zoom call meetings. However, its Microphone is positioned so low that I have to lift it up and talk to let others hear me properly. In the beginning I was confused, but when I started using mic in front of my mouth only then people were able to hear me out clearly. So I dind it as a drawbak, otherwise, no issues with the headphones in listening to misic or watching movies",3
"I am writing this review after using the TWS for few days. I purchased this for 1,499/-. Good tws for this price. Sound is good. Indian market usually focus on bass so mivi has given special attention to that. Battery is good, i have used it rigorously but still get decent battery life which totally depends on your use. Please read the instruction manual before using otherwise you will end not using the buds to the fullest. Talking about the negative side of the buds is that it has latency. I... READ MORE",4
I received this duopods on 19th Nov and am using them only once in a day. Till last week they were just working fine. However since last week it my right one has been acting funny. Its works on its own and stops on its own. So whats the point of having good sound quality bass etc.,3
"Good product , good quality and I am very proud to be Indian company ...",5
It doesnt sound good in MI phones. Volume is also not upto the mark.There is some compatibility issue. On other brands it sound very good and sound volume is also pretty good,3
"Sound quality is very good. This product comes with great bass with good battery backup. Pods can be charged near about 3-4 time in case and music playback time of pods are about 4-5hrs. The case took 1.5hrs to get fully charged. But there is no noise cancelation. and the mic quality is poor. While calling, the other person struggles to hear the voice. Otherwise its very good. Its comfortable to wear and Bluetooth range is good.",4
Its touch control and sound quality is good. Its design gives a new definition to the budget earphones. Bass is something that could be better but isn't at the moment.,4

Boult Audio Pro Bass Curve Pro is best in the price range. Battery backup is amazing. Superior sound quality and design. Light weight and easy to carry.Strong magnetic ear pieces. I liked this very much. Only drawback I found is the led indication. Very small led indicator. Value is more than what we paid. Thanks Boult for such a wonderful product.,5

jbl is the brand in terms of speaker and earphone. Although sound quality is quite nice but not happy with material quality. It looks like copy of jbl tune 205bt. Not happg with flipkart product. If you wish to buy just go jbl's official website. At least you will get original product.,3

Before this I was using jbl C100SI... Trebble was good and bass was okay... However if I compare this product with JBL on below points  1) Price: In this price range no other company can beat this product  2). Design: Again no match (what a wonderful design). It is a wonderful carved wooden and metallic drum.  3) Bass/Sound: Louder and bassy than JBL. However at low volume JBL perform beats were more clearer,5

I am much impressed with the facilities i am getting in this watch. But firstly the major thing that impressed me is that you dont feel like its a gadget to play upon. Its firstly a watch and they worked best to give us the best watch experience. The only lag which i came upon was that it does not have sleeping records. Whereas only 1k product like mi band also supports your sleeping records. I guess paying 32k and not getting these very small facilities may turn your good views off towards ... READ MORE,5

"Overall the look and the features are good, however I would like to highlight a few issues that I am facing.  The notifications do not appear, calls sometimes appear sometimes they don't, on the other hand inspite of linking the notifications for the msgs, the same is not working.  Battery backup is decent enough to sustain for three full days. The maps don't work properly, there is a lot of dependency on a good internet connection, but to what I understand the watch is connected with Blueto... READ MORE",3
"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.  After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent.",5
I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...

Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level. Thank you for such an amazing product.,4
watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory,5
Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.,5
"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.  Pros 1. Looks good and stylish 2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app 3. Vibration with notification is very strong  Cons 1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes 2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi 3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous",4
"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.  The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear... READ MORE",4

"1) Seller: pathetic. Poor packaging, dust all over watch. 2) Watch touch screen: very poor sensitivity 3) Operating system of the Watch: poorly designed. Very difficult to manoeuvre. 4) Display functions: Analysis like daily foot steps, sleep monitoring are shown in elementary format. No charts/graphical representation. It seems there is no provision to compare data on day to day basis. Just ad-hoc. 5) Battery: prima facie looked very bad in terms of hours run. Still testing.  In a nutshell,... READ MORE",1

"Writing this review after using Fitbit Ionic for around 2 days now. 1. Built quality and visual appeal is superb. 2. Very Light weight and looks awesome on the wrist. Very comfortable. 3. Connects smoothly with Fitbit app of Android. 4. Very accurate in terms of measurement especially heart rate and distance. 5. Display is bright and touch on the screen is smooth. 6. Battery is good. Using it for two days now and battery is still around 60%. Overall excellent, that's what I Can say as of no... READ MORE",5
finally its launched in india advance version of fitbit surge looking cool its really superior compared to other smart wathes + trackers cool daily use watch and fitness tracker.,5
"Nice product, so far so good.. battery life is good with HR continue on & notification with vibrator switch on works fine of 5 days. shipping was very fast Thanks to the dealer and flipkart",5
"Can't thank flipkart enough for helping me replace the watch.. 5stars for flipkart services. And aabout fitbit, there's nothing to say.. its a great smartwatch. battery is really lasting, app interfaces are friendly, fitness tracking is supperbbbbbb.. loving it",5
"fitbit ionic is just a mind blowing fantastic piece of gadget which gives so much of insight about ones fitness. classy look, crystal clear display with bright illumination, amazing touch sensitivity and user friendly interface. best part is sleep stages tracking & continuous heart rate monitoring. battery lives upto expectations. highly recommended, one simply cannot find a single flip side if looking for a true fitness watch.",5
"Pros: Product wise it is the best fitness tracker you can get. The strength of the vibration is amazing. Battery life is very good 5+ days. FitBit app is very user friendly and helps to achieve our fitness goal.  Cons: It has limited support for third party apps. You can receive notifications from your phone but cannot respond back, no speaker and microphone. Priced much higher for the features it offers.",4
"Something very useful for everyone. In today's world where health has taken a paramount importance, this product helps you take that important plunge into the world of fitness. One of the few products with built in GPS, you don't need to carry your phone to track your path. The phone comes with 2.5 GB of useful space for storing music and apps. U can stream the music into your Bluetooth headphones, another reason to leave back your phone. The trendy look of the watch takes it above most of th... READ MORE",5
Great buy. Accurate measurements.light on the hand. Smooth and responsive touch screen.value for money,5
Great design. Almost weightless. Very comfortable. Rich look. Desirable Accuracy. Provide you all the details of your health at any given time. Previous data available easily. Facilitate you to sleep better at night and facilitate to keep your day time lifestyle active. Thank you Fitbit and thank you Flipkart.,5
good for running cycling but while swimming HR manager is not working.. apart from that this will be good one.. but cost wise not ok,4

Worthless watch. Insufficient manual. Does not say how to activate the device. It's a waste. No support from flipkart or seller or product manufacturer. Don't waste your money.,1

"Writing this review after using Fitbit Ionic for around 2 days now. 1. Built quality and visual appeal is superb. 2. Very Light weight and looks awesome on the wrist. Very comfortable. 3. Connects smoothly with Fitbit app of Android. 4. Very accurate in terms of measurement especially heart rate and distance. 5. Display is bright and touch on the screen is smooth. 6. Battery is good. Using it for two days now and battery is still around 60%. Overall excellent, that's what I Can say as of no... READ MORE",5
finally its launched in india advance version of fitbit surge looking cool its really superior compared to other smart wathes + trackers cool daily use watch and fitness tracker.,5
"Nice product, so far so good.. battery life is good with HR continue on & notification with vibrator switch on works fine of 5 days. shipping was very fast Thanks to the dealer and flipkart",5
"Can't thank flipkart enough for helping me replace the watch.. 5stars for flipkart services. And aabout fitbit, there's nothing to say.. its a great smartwatch. battery is really lasting, app interfaces are friendly, fitness tracking is supperbbbbbb.. loving it",5
"fitbit ionic is just a mind blowing fantastic piece of gadget which gives so much of insight about ones fitness. classy look, crystal clear display with bright illumination, amazing touch sensitivity and user friendly interface. best part is sleep stages tracking & continuous heart rate monitoring. battery lives upto expectations. highly recommended, one simply cannot find a single flip side if looking for a true fitness watch.",5
"Pros: Product wise it is the best fitness tracker you can get. The strength of the vibration is amazing. Battery life is very good 5+ days. FitBit app is very user friendly and helps to achieve our fitness goal.  Cons: It has limited support for third party apps. You can receive notifications from your phone but cannot respond back, no speaker and microphone. Priced much higher for the features it offers.",4
"Something very useful for everyone. In today's world where health has taken a paramount importance, this product helps you take that important plunge into the world of fitness. One of the few products with built in GPS, you don't need to carry your phone to track your path. The phone comes with 2.5 GB of useful space for storing music and apps. U can stream the music into your Bluetooth headphones, another reason to leave back your phone. The trendy look of the watch takes it above most of th... READ MORE",5
Great buy. Accurate measurements.light on the hand. Smooth and responsive touch screen.value for money,5
Great design. Almost weightless. Very comfortable. Rich look. Desirable Accuracy. Provide you all the details of your health at any given time. Previous data available easily. Facilitate you to sleep better at night and facilitate to keep your day time lifestyle active. Thank you Fitbit and thank you Flipkart.,5

"1) Seller: pathetic. Poor packaging, dust all over watch. 2) Watch touch screen: very poor sensitivity 3) Operating system of the Watch: poorly designed. Very difficult to manoeuvre. 4) Display functions: Analysis like daily foot steps, sleep monitoring are shown in elementary format. No charts/graphical representation. It seems there is no provision to compare data on day to day basis. Just ad-hoc. 5) Battery: prima facie looked very bad in terms of hours run. Still testing.  In a nutshell,... READ MORE",1

"i bought this for my Amazfit Verge Smartwatch....  the best part of this product is the installation. its very satisfying as they give so many things with this. wet wipe, dry wipe, dust remover sticker, cleaning cloth, additional sticker strip to place the screen guard, a small suction cup etc. the packaging is very premium.  however installation needs to be done very precisely. the suction cup is very useful as i ended up with wrong placement of the screen guard but then i pulled it up with ...

"I'm not satisfied with the product & the battery gaves only two days backup, it's perform very slow some times double tap to wake-up doesn't work sometimes wrist up function not working and the weather forecast is always shows no data overall performance is not good. I'm not happy to buy this. I'm very much satisfied with the amazfit verge lite performance.",3
This is a good watch and functions well for the fitness related features ... sync with iPhone is a bit difficult but android sync and features may be good You can buy this if you are looking for a decent watch with reasonable features,5
"Very good product, Delivery is within correct time and delivery person was polite and humble",5
"Good quality smart watch.. Premium look...Got a software update after one week of usage.. Working perfect, after update new watch faces installed..Phone calling & answer feature also works well...speaker volume less...but ok...Phone app notifications works well... Smart watch features are also good.. Little bit priced high,but got the watch below 10K.... Recommend for use...",5
awesome watch display is also very good its better then apple smart watch m giving 10 out 9 m very satisfied with this watch.,5
Pros: Awesome AMOLED screen Touch response is lightning Battery backup is nice(4-5) Internal storage of 4 GB 23 watch faces (after upgrade) Heart rate sensor is accurate  Cons: Under the sunlight screen becomes little shiny So the visibility is not that good. Heart rate sensor takes more time than usual Charging dock is very big.  Overall i give 8/10..,5
This product is a dump from huami and it is frequently crashing and not synced with the phone all time. i was totally unsatisfied with this product. Only thing i convinced is the amoled display. But it is totally waste of money to spend 10k for amoled display watch. Recently i am facing battery drain issue (within 13hrs it has almost drained to 12%). Dont expect any smartness in this watch.,1
the watch worked okay for first day but after that the battery started to drain out very fast then the watch stopped giving me notifications and I even had to factory reset it 3 time to function properly,1

"Friends, plz don't check on the negetive comments. The product what we are getting at this price is more than sufficient. Getting perfectly synchronised with iPhone and as well as Android. We cannot expect something equivalent to an an Apple watch at this price. The watch may not be super big one in size, but if u have a moderate physique, it will definitely worth buying. The heart rate monitor is not accurate, which hardly matters to me, since I'm not a heart patient. The speaker is ok, not ... READ MORE",4
It's a really good product from Flipkart and gives you the feel of rs 10 k smart watch..

This is a good smart in this range...,5
"Im writing this after 2 years of my Purchase. Bought this at an offee price if Rs. 4000 & it worths my money atleast 4X times. Great product, Fantastic Design, Strong Mechanics & Totally Water Resistant (im saying this after drenced in rain, swimmed for atleast 30mins). Great product at a very low, affordable price. Go, get it!",5
This is my first smart watch. I am using it from last 15 days and Very good budget watch. Do not compare it with other Fossil or Zen watches. Smooth touch. Looks good on wrist. All the basic functions are working perfectly. This is not android watch and you can not install from the play store. Limited in built-in face watches and 4-5 are ready to install. Battery is awesome. Syncing in fundo application easily. Call function works nice. Speaker is almost good.,5
"Looks and fit wise the watch is superb . The reason for 1 star is when it comes to the function.  The step counter is stupid and false , without doing anything it shows a lots of steps. Where as after running for 4Kms it just reads 2.8kms that's a Joke .  Top add up with this is the heart rate monitors. After a 4 Kms run, it ready your heart rate as 45bpm, 61bpm and then 91 BPM. Which is completely wrong .  Hence don't buy the item if your looking for fitness functions . Apart from tha... READ MORE",1

When I order this watch little bit scare think that the watch will be good or bad bt when I receive it believe me it's a very nice watch the watch is like that how it describe ....I recommend all of you go for it with no hesitate,5
very bad quality product...bluetooth doesn't work and the quality of plastic & rubber used is very cheap. I have to spend Rs 800 to buy the watch which is not even worth of Rs 300. please do not but this product and rememer there is no money refund policy for this product.,1
The watch has good features and for the price it is totally worth it. The only issue I have is that the battery barely lasts for like 15mins even after full charge for about an hour. So I wouldn't recommend it just because of this reason.,3

Got the product delivered on time. The watch feels great to wear and use. Highly recommended to those looking for a smart watch. The fitness tracking also works nicely. Currently wearing it with a stainless steel milanese band. Looks clean and professional.,5
"The watch is just awesome. Worth the money. I have been using it for the last 4 months. It is super stylish. It will definitely turn heads. For men medium size is perfect (even for small wrists). Just order it, you won't regret. With the new watch OS 4 release it going to only get better. Eagerly waiting for the update.",5
one of the best smart watch. Best accessories recommended for i phone.,5
Oh great one last few day s m using it. Good. But i think samsung gear s3 frontier is beatten up. I like more than that. But nice packaging from flipkart. Fastest delivery great prpduct.,5

The Apple Watch Series - 2 is a work of art! It syncs really well with my iPhone 6S Plus.  A really great buy!,5
Great product and works super smooth. 42mm is the correct size for average people.,5
"After using for a short period of time, it gives professional experience. Great quality product with this budget. I want you to prefer Sony alpha ILCE -6000Y for beginner photography. cinematic video recording is awesome at this price. I just attaching few photos below to show my experience.",5
Best camara at this price point and sony have most satisfying technology then others. Kit lenses are enough to capture high quality images Attaching some shots captured with my sony alpha 6000 kit lenses,5

Wonderful and technically perfect camera at half the price of a highend DSLR camera. Recently I had been to Goa and Ooty and shot many pics which are beautiful and clear. Having very good experience with this camera.  C Bhattacharya,5

Very fine detailing in photos... compact size is definitely a huge Advantage over DSLRs.. for the same quality of the images...  also, Good offer price by Flipkart and quick delivery...",5
Delivered before time so good job flipkart.. I have very little knowledge on photography. I am total amateur. But everyday I'm learning new stuffs and I'm loving it. It was a good deal..,5
"I brought this product recently. Pretty much satisfied with the product and the quality of images. Along with, I brought 10000amh power bank so that I can charge the camera when the charging level is lower. I am a Sony lover so I did not see any potential drawbacks.",5
If you are a beginner i would suggest buy the body alone and then get a good glass. Pair this baby with a Sigma 30mm f1.4 and Boom You get super sharp images wit that nice Bokeh BG ;) Started loving Mirror less and my next upgrade will be a Sony Full frame. #MirrorlessFTW,5
"For a beginner, this Camera seems to be the best mirrorless option Available w.r.t price and features.  A rapid fast 2 Day delivery earns my kudos. Good packaging with the additional Fuji bag and SD card is also included.  Initial impressions of the Camera is positive. Good picture quality with the provided kit lenses although I had more fun with the 55-230 mm lens. Easy to understand interface with easy image capture.  You can wirelessly transmit photos from the camera to your phone throug... READ MORE",4
It's a nice budget entry level mirrorless camera with whole lot of features. Auto focus is amazing for stills and 3/5 for moving objects. Picture clarity is also amazing with different resolutions and quality to pick from. Video quality is also amazing but limited to 15 mins. Night photography is also good with night mode. Overall it's a very good deal except a little focus problems for moving objects or when u take a burst shot.,5
People who ever plan to progress from novice to mid level photography go for this instead of Canon m50.... it has amazing JPEGs too... canon m50 wins only in the auto focus department,5
it's a awesome camera loved it. really underrated.  if you really confused between these and cannon m50 mark 2 i suggest save some money and go for it. type c charging. bigger sensor lot of lenses available. just go for it. display of its like a smart phone. menus are really simple and easy to use. touch are smooth.. just good for everything...,5
"After 3 days of usage: I'm very unimpressed by the build quality. Even the lenses are not that will built. It also heats up pretty quickly, but the heat doesn't impair it's functioning. And the battery is pretty slow to charge inside of the camera, but maybe that's the case with all camera batteries and I've been spoilt by fast charging in smartphones :p  Other than that, it's a great camera.

Value for money Superb,5
"As you know without lenses cameras are nothing. And Sony lenses are very expensive. It's not just a beginner level camera, its more than that, so if you are beginner and have high budget then only go for this camera. It can take amazing shots but you need spend more money in lenses. Kit lens is okay, but I will suggest you 50mm F/1.8 (or 1.4 if you are rich enough to buy ) lens if you are new to photography. Else go out and have some research. Take decision wisely.

Best Apsc camera in the market period. The thing that distinguish it from competition is the autofocus speed which even far superior than almost 99 camera under 2 lakh. Also for a beginner such as me it's a good investment as learning camera and it can also be used professionally provided with right lenses. a6000 is also equally good if you are tight on budget.

wow..amazing,5
Great camera,5
awesome camera best apsc camera in the world,5
awesome,5
I'm just a beginner and only takes casual photos. This is my first interchangeable lense camera. Hope this review helps  The camera has a good grip and is comfortable for holding. The performance is lowlight is much better than I expected. The navigation and buttons are user friendly.  But I would highly recommend to purchase the body only version if it's available. The kit lens is very average and does not exploit the full features of the camera.,5
I bought this as a second camera.  One of the best mid-segment camera (APS-C) I've ever used in terms of movie & Still quality. Strong alloy body protects itself from drops and falls. Very fast focusing. Tracking focus is amazing. Undoubtedly a competitor for Sony 6600.  My usage is for shooting short films and promos. I strongly recommend this for budding professionals in this field.  Pros: 1) Ideally sized. 2) Amazing still quality. 3) Great slow motion (120p) in FHD. 4) Nice movie qual... READ MORE,5

It's a great camera if you want to adopt more lenses. And it is easy to operate.,5
Fabulous camera,4
Perfect camera for beginners. But Canon EFM lenses are not easily available but you can use Sigma lenses overall a very good camera.,5
Wonderful camera best autofocus good picture quality,5
Working fine but one thing I want to mention is that the 16GB card that comes with it cannot record in 4k. So better buy yourself a good high capacity SD Card.,5
"Delivery was delayed a little bit, it was worth the wait.  This camera have top of the line features and great build quality. With battery and 15-135mm lens, it weighs around or above 1kg. Feels premium in hand.  If you are on budget and looking for same specs camera in canon go for M6 mark ii, which have almost everything equal to EOS90D.",5

"Great camera!!! Took some time to understand all the basics of photography... Its giving good quality pictures. I shoot raw, and post processing the images are coming really well. Autofocus is nice and 5fps is working well for me... 300mm lens is OK... need to get another one since i mostly do birds.. need more zoom üòä Overall its a great camera for beginners!!!!",5
"Best Mid range camera for photography lovers. I am writing the review after 3 months of using this cam , this is my 1st DSLR canon is a user friendly cam, it is basically good for videography. Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses",5
If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.,5
"Excellent camera for beginner photographers and also a best back up for pro also. Amazing colour depth, fast focusing, crystal clear photo. Lightweight is a advantage while you are travelling.

"You can't have a better mid-range DSLR. However I don't like 18mm-55mm lens, but you'll get sharp and crisp photos with 70mm-300mm lens. The camera is feature loaded and very light. You'll love it.",5
"Awesome product. If you are looking for semi-pro DSLR you can buy this without it thinking. Easy handling, easy handy features",5
"I think this the best entry level dslr in this range. I got a 18-55mm kit lense, 16gb memory card and lowepro bag. Bag quality is good. This model is good because you are getting a touch screen enabled dslr in the price range where most of other brands giving non touch screen models.

"Wow, love the Camera....I have already used Nikon d 3500 in my Laboratory but this camera is far better. Flipkart delivered at time and the product was at best conditions. This is my first personal DSLR, so guys after using for 2 weeks, I must say that go for it, there is no other camera which could provide same level as Nikon d 5600. Colour tone production, lots of effect, smooth touch screen, good battery life, etc. Just go for it.",5
No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...

"Love this camera, I have used sony a6000 before this and the video quality is way better, there is still problem of rolling shutter but for my use of slow pan Or still video recording it works just fine. Autofocus is FastAF and touchscreen makes it much more easy. I would suggest to buy body only if you know how to use a camera, but if don't kit lens will be a great start.

"Bought this DSLR on Big billion sale. Very happy with the performence through 18-55 stm lens. Some sample photos which I have transferred to my mobile, are attached here. I am extremely happy with its low light performance. All the photos here are unedited. I was bit confused between M50 and 200d mark II but atlast choosed the later one for its wide variety of lens options.",5
"So, The camera comes with a standard lens to get you started. The build quality is great. Feels good in the hand. Lightweight and compact. This comes with the new Digic 8 image processor. And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend. If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off.",5

I have some image of portraits that we take with this product with kit lense 18-55mm the result is great. I have neutral the colure, contrast,and also saturation.",5
"It's the best for the price, especially in video department. Only con i found that, 3.5 mm jack won't support TRRS directly. It supports TRS.",4
This is a really good DSLR by canon . I was confused between Canon and Nikon. But I came to know that Nikon is only good for photography and the video quality is not upto mark. This Canon dslr is really awesome with great features. Anyone searching for a good camera under 50000 should go for this model. It's good in both video and photo.,5
A good camera for photography as well as for videography . Recommended for vlogging . If you are looking for mid range videography camera than Canon 200 markII is the best else for photography go for Nikon 5300 . And finally thanks Flipkart for smooth delivery,4

excellent dslr and get a free moto headset worth 6500 I am happy,5
Camera is very good. Although EVF & Kit lens aren't that great but yeah manageable to deal with! Rest is best! Eye auto focus is remarkable. I used sony 50mm F1.8 lens with it. The results are great. Buy a gimbal or mini-tripod for awesome vlogging. Shoots good videos,5
Best in this budget,5

One of the finest Dslr camera i hv ever seen... No need to think.. jst go and grab it.. if u need a high mid rnge Semi professional Camera go for it.. no will able to mke Difference between a pro nd this Semi pro.. because it has the Same ExSpeed processor which nikkon D50 has.... So.. i just loved it... Go for it...,5
"The best camera for someone just getting into Professional Photography. It's got buttons and dials for all the settings, you'll almost never use on screen controls. It has got touch to capture makes it so much easier to give camera to someone to capture things for you.  Though it takes amazing 4K videos, I do not recommend it to vloggers. It is too heavy to be carried in one hand and the screen articulates only at the back, so you can't see yourself while you record.  I need not talk about ... READ MORE",5
"Nikon D7500 is a semi-professional camera built with high-end features. Buying this range product from e-commerce websites is little sceptical in India. I had many questions related to seller, warranty, genuineness before buying this product.  I received this product in three days at my door. When I opened it was unsealed and I was 100% satisfied with delivery and genuineness.

You can compare and see the technical differences yourself but what I can tell you is I LOVE this camera. It is super fast at 8FPS, the group focus is excellent, color beautiful and love the Bluetooth. When it came down to pro vs con, the 7500 won.

"I have been using Nikon D5100 for past 6 years, which has served me well. I was looking for a camera under 70000. Nikon D7500 and Z50 were the options available in Nikon Line up. Other brands like Canon and Sony had some mirror less offering at the same price but i had no plans to leave Nikon Family.  Z50: Is a good entry level mirror less camera.

There is severe overheating when shooting 4k and even 1080p. I suspect this is the reason why they stopped production of xa7 in the US. The camera turns off after 5-6mins of 4k and 15-18mins of HD due to heating even though it's rated for 15mins and 29.59 for HD..,1

"Best Mid range camera for photography lovers. I am writing the review after 3 months of using this cam , this is my 1st DSLR canon is a user friendly cam, it is basically good for videography. Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses",5
If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.,5

No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...

it's a awesome camera loved it. really underrated.  if you really confused between these and cannon m50 mark 2 i suggest save some money and go for it. type c charging. bigger sensor lot of lenses available. just go for it. display of its like a smart phone. menus are really simple and easy to use. touch are smooth.. just good for everything...,5
"After 3 days of usage: I'm very unimpressed by the build quality. Even the lenses are not that will built. It also heats up pretty quickly, but the heat doesn't impair it's functioning. And the battery is pretty slow to charge inside of the camera, but maybe that's the case with all camera batteries and I've been spoilt by fast charging in smartphones :p  Other than that, it's a great camera. You can get amazing photos with it if you know what you're doing. Focus works really well, and the ov... READ MORE",4
My first mirroless camera. After searching a lot of reviews and suggestions I bought this one. Simple suberb.,5
Awesome camera in this price range.,4
Pros- Image Quality Colour reproduction WiFi/Bluetooth Usb type C Cons- difficult to adjust for beginners 15mins 4K recording  I am in love with this product will re rate after 3-4 months usage,5
Amazing... User friendly! Very good picture and video quality! Loving it:),5
Value for money Superb,5
"Its value for money for enthusiast level photographers, photos are crisp and sharp! Focus is good may not be the best, colours are accurate and do justice.. The biggest downside is the battery, when coming from normal SLR the battery is only half efficient. Taking videos drains more battery so its always necessary to have a spare battery...Autofocus may be improved in future by firmware updates",4
"great camera ..... considering the price , it offers complete set features . I would rather say it gives you all the features of sony and canon camera combined in one camera . The body is sturdy ,grip is nice , menu is easy to navigate.It is my first camera and I got this as a gift from my wife on our anniversary. I just love this camera. This camera is like mini z6/z7 with a dx format sensor and anyone looking for a mirrorless or dslr at this price must go for this camera.",5
The images are crisp. It is easy to learn for beginners like me. The autofocus is very good. And it has the best grip among all mirrorless cameras.,5
Review after 15 days of use. Handling and build quality that i like the most of this camera. Picture quality is decent with kit lens. Nikon is known for dynamic range which this camera delivers very easily. Video quality is great. Focusing system is quite awkward not like sony or canon but average. Overall decent camera in this price range. Only drawback is with Z50 that limited range of lenses or quite expensive.,4
Excellent product...came with camera bag+64 GB Memory card..thanks @flipkart‚ù§,5
This is awesome üòçüòçüòç quality is excellent üòçüòçüòç,5
Very well-designed product. Lens are great. Options and accessibility are spot on  The LCD pops out in reverse making it difficult for use with a tripod.,5

"Bought this DSLR on Big billion sale. Very happy with the performence through 18-55 stm lens. Some sample photos which I have transferred to my mobile, are attached here. I am extremely happy with its low light performance. All the photos here are unedited. I was bit confused between M50 and 200d mark II but atlast choosed the later one for its wide variety of lens options.",5
"So, The camera comes with a standard lens to get you started. The build quality is great. Feels good in the hand. Lightweight and compact. This comes with the new Digic 8 image processor. And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend. If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off.",5
"Product is amazing, The Build quality is nice and the image quality is awesome. The auto focus is smooth as butter. Best for videos.",5
Absolutely brilliant camera!!   Got it in a very good deal and this is my first DSLR camera. Very much impressed with the features and cameraüëåüèª very good camera for all the beginners,5

"It was amazing product.. I'm really happy with that... I'm from north-east india. And purchasing product online is not so trendy. But i know well flipkart never take a risk. They send me the product very well... Packaging is good.. And also the product what you expect is great. I have some image of portraits that we take with this product with kit lense 18-55mm the result is great. I have neutral the colure, contrast,and also saturation.",5
"It's the best for the price, especially in video department. Only con i found that, 3.5 mm jack won't support TRRS directly. It supports TRS.",4
This is a really good DSLR by canon . I was confused between Canon and Nikon. But I came to know that Nikon is only good for photography and the video quality is not upto mark. This Canon dslr is really awesome with great features. Anyone searching for a good camera under 50000 should go for this model. It's good in both video and photo.,5
A good camera for photography as well as for videography . Recommended for vlogging . If you are looking for mid range videography camera than Canon 200 markII is the best else for photography go for Nikon 5300 . And finally thanks Flipkart for smooth delivery,4
Best camera....Its so easy to operate and the autofocus is best in class..Highly recommended for all those who needs to do photography as well as videography...I'm a begginer and I'm posting the photoes of my first day click...,5

Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses",5
If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.,5

Colour tone production, lots of effect, smooth touch screen, good battery life, etc. Just go for it.",5
No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...

"Quite a nice product for beginners. Stable? Yes. Looks professional? No. The quality of the tripod is a little flimsy, not as strong as my old one: Sonia PH-770, but does the job. Can be used for amateur photography and videography, on solid ground only.",4
"The Quality is very durable and sturdy, plus the controls provided are really nifty. Especially the mechanisms to shorten and elongate legs. Very smooth and convenient it is. All in all, very satisfied with the product.",5
"The build quality is good. It is built with lightweight fluid head with adjustable pan and quick release plate with security and tilt locks. Multi purpose head with quick release lever, easy accessory hook are some of the other features. The tripod comes with a carry bag as well as a quick release plate.  Overall, it‚Äôs worth its price.",5
"This tripod is amazing. It can easily sustain the weight of a DSLR The water bubble for leveling is great.  You can use it with a camera, a phone without even worry.  I majority use for cinema shots that great.  The height is really good. The product is steady and great The finishing is amazing.  Go for it",5

"Good product overall.  Had a great experience with this one, although I was reluctant to buy it after going through reviews.   Pros:  6+ ft height Nice stability, with padded bottom, holds still. Knobs are easy to lock and unlock.  Cons: Sometimes (2 out of 10 times), adjusting the height demands extra effort while rotating the know and locking it up. But works well.  Got only a cheap mobile holder (not recommended) with the package, and no rotating head.  Bought a separate mobile holder t... READ MORE",4

This is very nice tripod and it is very helpful for the mobiles. This tripod work properly so nice,5
"It's good n light tripod, better if you use for mobile shooting only. That one star difference is just because of price...

I am very happy you should go for it. You can also visit my YouTube channel ""jagraneducation"" To see it unboxing. Tysm.",5

"It's good but only thing is it's a bit light and the quality is not that great,very flimsy.But great for the price and works well.",5
"To be honest, if you can compromise with quality and need a tripod for home use, I will recommend this. But if you like to tracel and need a sturdy companion, this isn't what you are liiking for. The alluminium grade is light and will not handle any pressure upon impact. I think, even wind can make it shake. So, if you are gonna make tiktok videos or similar, you can give it a shot. The height is like 3.5 feet. The mobile gripp is very strong. I think its enough to crush budget phones. xD",2

nice product I just got in 899rs in sale... good Quality. good plastic material. almost 1.3kg good budget tripod for beginners..,4
This tripod is very amazing. I like this tripod because it is just a little tall than me and it is very steady. But the best thing about this tripod is its head. At this price it is the best tripod. It is also very light weight and we can carry it easily. I can easily attach my cannon 1300D on it as well as my smartphone on it. It simple words it is awesome.,5

Really the quality of the Tripod is awesome and the alignment of each leg with other is perfect. It also has a hooke in the center rod with which you can add more weight to increase the stability.

"I think it's a very good product , overall strength is good. But one thing i would say is ,last leg is very weak and the phone holder is also some what not good in quality , spring loosen in very early stage only after three or four stretch. But even after that it provides good value for money . If you are buying it only for a phone then it's very good . I loved it.",4

-Quite sturdy. -Light weight. -Ball joint is a pro and con both ...pro for mobile but I personally didn't feel reliable for camera . -Legs are much more flexible than gorilla tripod so it can be fit in almost every possible place . -Best for vlogging. -The rubbery texture in legs helps to get better grip.  Worth the money ‚ò∫Ô∏è,5
This item is gives u satisfaction on another level! Was worried about the build quality. But its too much sturdy and trustworthy. Have a ball head which is adjustable also can be removed if u wanna fit the camera. It was able to support my canon 700d with both normal and zoom lens. Can easily grip or clings as it has foldable legs. You can go for it as an entry level mini tripod for photography or vlogging.  REVIEW: 1ST FEB 2021  Knob to tighten the ball head broke had to fix it by fevicol.,5
"Nice products , I loved it, I recommend to all who wants to vlogging and also for studio of youtubers",4

"Easy to install, looks great, value for money. Overall, very pleased with the product. Didn't disappoint.",5
The device is really nice and stand is sturdy as well. Will totally recommend this for a multiple monitor setup since the bezels are really thin.,5
Good for office work. But there is one problem. Its panel is a cheap one and emits high radiation which is not good for eyes or body at all. I recommend a reputed brand like Dell or Samsung or any good brand if you love your eyes. Or buy a cheap panel like this one and pay your medical bills later. I returned the product.,3

"Wonderful products. I purchased at around Rs. 7100. It's decent at that price point.  Pros  - Bezel-less screen - Mat finish so no reflection from behind - Tilt display - Great viewing angels - Sharp colors  Cons  - Can't wall mount - Not a telescopic, can't increase the height",4
Amazing monitor. Perfect addon for my laptop at work. Display is bright and images are crystal clear. Would highly recommend it,5
"Dell is best in the monitors,  Pros: Perfect colour tone Hd display Thin brisels Good viewing angel No eyes strain as I used regularly for 8 hours in day continuesly (atleast I not found any eyes strain in this display)  I found only one con in this product If dell provide one more HDMI port in this monitor then the deal will be more awesome, otherwise this is the best in the market.  Thanks flipkart for proving genuine product üëç",4

Price got reduced by 1000 by the time my order was delivered. Is it possible to return the product and order the new one with cheaper price!  The base of the stand delivered to me looks to have a very minor scratch like it was already used. And a screw on the back side of the monitor looked loosened and worn out. I tightened it up to insert the stand. Hope the product is fresh and not the used one. Product is good and this review is for seller.,3

Nice monitor from acer. I love it.. Slim and white color gives rich look to the monitor.,5
"Display is excellent. Good amount of brightness with natural colors. Bezel is thin, with white color, is an absolute beauty. The display is thin giving it the edge over monitors from Dell. At this price point, it's an excellent buy. Couple of shortcomings though. Monitor cannot be tilted or adjusted for height. The speakers are not even audible enough. Even the Mac Mini's internal speakers are better.",4
It is awesome looking monitor and very good performance. My old monitor is also of Acer X153w and I purchased it in 2010 and still works perfectly so I decided to go again with Acer. At this price tag its worth buying. Packaging was good and on time delivery.,5

"Let's start with real world performance. The monitor looks chic and the slim bezels wows. The brightness is adequate and colours pop decently. The image is pretty sharp too. Now coming to the more technical side, the monitor can be easily over clocked to 75Hz for a smoother gaming experience. I got the monitor for Rs 7700 in sale and at this price it's a steal!!",4
Giving review after 10 days. I am satisfied with this monitor. If you are looking for office work then its great choice. I bought this after reading review. Eye care technology is good.

I bought it for my PC and PS3. First of all Picture quality and viewing angles are great. The bright intelligence is such a nice feature especially at this price range. You can use it with lights on or off without having to adjust the brightness constantly. Been using it for a week and I haven't had any dead pixels yet. There is a slight light bleeding In the bottom 2 corners which is very common for ips panel displays. Highly recommended for movie streaming or console gaming.,5

Best display for the price point.I got it for 9.5K.Good colours.Especially the blacks are similar to oled blacks(look the pics).

At first i got a damaged product but flipkart was fast in arranging a replacement. The replacement effort really increased my faith in online purchases. Thank you flipkart.

If you are looking for a big screen at a low price and ready to compromise a little on text quality go for it.,4

Value for money monitor for WFH people. VGA ccable is given in box. Only cons for me was the 16A power adapter for which I had to buy a conversion board,5

For editing purpose it's really good,5

Superb led which gives me 165hz gaming display when connect with dp cable. If you connect with hdmi you will get 125hz so its good to go with a gpu for gaming purpose. I got this at 10300 which is so cheap and product received before the time. Thanks to flipkart.,5

IPS will never achieve a 1ms response time, also 16ms is the min possible response time acheievd on a 60hz display. Visual quality is not good as an IPS panel display you will need to tweak the display for best colours and quality",3
"A fairly good Monitor at this price range!! but if you are buying it to play fps game then go for something smaller like a 19.5 inch screen 900p resolution monitor! this is super good everything is great. but as i was a 14.5"" monitor user before this one. i am having difficulties playing csgo on this. but with time i'll get use to it!! overall a great deal and best monitor in under 10k range",5
Amazing product with 1 ms response time. It has a decent speaker as well. Its pretty good tbh. For those who are saying no speaker they just dont know how to set it up. Use either a HDMI cable or the 3.5mm cable(which is provided in the box) for audio. No HDMI cable provided in the box tho. The viewing angles are pretty good for something without an ips display. The only thing is that its 60hz refresh rate and not 75.  And for ur info i bought this during big billion days for lesser price....,5
Best Budget Gaming monitor with 1080p. Worth buying.,5
every thing is good but the speakers are not loud,4

Beautiful product. Wonderful display. When you plug in the monitor you need to press the power button in the back side of the monitor. 144Hz. 2 HDMI and 1 display port. Bit heavy monitor. No audio port in monitor. There is no option to choose response time from monitor. Saturation is bit along with colour calibration.,5
The resolution for this is good. Not evident while watching movies or seeing high resolution pictures. But some may feel the text is pixalated just a bit while working on other softwares like excel if you are too close to monitor. One drawback is we can't adjust the height,5

Monitor is great on its own but it wasn't a worthy upgrade for me or my expectations were more from it being an IPS display. I had a samsung monitor previously with VA panel and it was working perfectly. Never faced any issues.

But I got tempted into buying an IPS display monitor after seeing it's features and reviews so I unnecessarily spent money on this.  Now comparing it to my 8 year old sams... READ MORE,4

Happy With the quick delivery of flipkart. But the actual resolution of the monitor is 1366 x 768 not 1600 x 900 as written on the description.so beware of that. And the other thing. I only got this product today so I can't say more about this monitor. But I can say one thing for sure this monitor is pretty much satisfactory for its cost. Maybe I will re-edit this review after using this product for some days.,4

Best products in this Price range (16599 With dis.. offer) Colour and contrast are good U can also set refresh rate 60 to 144 Monitor design and look is so good some monitor support only G-SYNC OR Free Sync but HP x24 is compatible for both no matter which GPU you use Radeon/Nvidia,5
It's been six months. This monitor is what makes my gaming experience smooth and enjoyable. The speaker is so loud that sometimes I have to decrease the volume.,5
"Except sound quality , other things are perfect",4
Excellent,5
For nvidia g sync DP cable is required. It comes with hdmi cable. Speaker is fine for small range (user monitor distance). Some one mentioned in comment they can't read text property for that you can increase sharpness. There are lot of setting to explore. In Microsoft store hp display application is available on which you can do all setting without touching monitor button that application I like.

Very nice monitor. I am very happy,5
Nice,1
"superb product, total value for money...",5
Found the product quite good and best under value. Would surely advice anyone to go for it. But you should also be able to live with the fact that isn't adjustable according to your wish. Also if there is any other color variant available then please go with a darker variant. It won't stay study and might wobble a little if there is any movement of the desk it is kept on.  All over itt a good and a valuable product to buy.,5
Good one,5
Clear picture and thinner screen,5

After using it from months. I would recommend it. It's best product for ultra slim and light weight. It has awesome vivid picture quality and nice build quality with bezeless experience. Country of origin is CHINA. And speakers are pretty good but external speaker are needed if you want better and higher sound quality.

"Very old company from US, not very popular in India. Anyway coming to the product, the build quality is not that good, except the neck of the monitor and the base. They are all metal and sturdy. The monitor can be tilted but cannot be made up and down. The bezel at the left, right and the bottom of the monitor are little loose. Found heating issue near the power button.

"Fantastic product & have bought it for 14,499 rs while it was on sale. Simply the best TN panel within 20k range. Blacks are deep, colour looks natural, punchy & sharp. A true 1ms monitor with input lag lesser than 2. This is the reason this monitor is still being sold in huge numbers. Truly a good product from Asus.",5
I LOVES THIS PRODUCT..ITS AMAZING...REALLY TRUE GAMING EXPERIENCE.GREAT JOB ASUS.144HZ AND FEATURE PROOF MONITOR.,5

Picture quality good.good interface.I am using this monitor in Mi Box 4K. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that this monitor doesn't have very good material. But it is a very good monitor if used without much pressure,4

Brightness is low and black spot,1
At this price point picture quality is very good. Viewing angle is also pretty good üëå... Build quality is good for this price range...,5
Power adapter is outside monitor so it's welcome feature. Samsung is also using same feature. One of the cheapest but still full of quality IPS display. No HDMI input given but it's ok as we can't expect HDMI in this price. Value for money monitor with great vibrant Display.,5
"Good product, reasonable price, on time delivery. Product worth the price. So happy with Flipkart service.",5
What a beautiful monitor.. Display is superb and viewing angle is also very good. It can't be better.  HDMi is not available in this particular model,5

I am very impressed with the product...for a person coming from low end monitor will definitely love the monitor..the IPS panel is really good and it is a treat to watch movies on this one..,5
nice monitor. good for viewing movies and pics ..but not recommend for games as screen size is too big,4
Ok,3
nice product with reasonable price,5
Best in class monitor. Very slim and bezeless. Got it for 8399 which is very economical btw. I kept boost black levels to 0 to reduce the greyish shade on the black scene. And super sharpness to increase the readability. Blindly go for it,5

So far so good....loved the slimness...quality product...,5
Good monitor value for money,4
"Good looking and super slim, excellent display quality, but max speaker output is less than a cheap mobile phone and it Does Not have audio out or earphone ports. So it fails as a multimedia device and operates mainly as a PC display. Without proper audio using it for a PS4 or with a firestick is just not possible",4
Best monitor under 10000,5
Very good display ...but delayed delivery.... totally missmatch between Flipkart and logistics services.,4
Audio is too low. Thats the only disappointment... otherwise great product. Looks premium.,4
Very poor don't buy. Screen is too thin get damaged easily and then no repair and replacement option. U have only one option to buy a new one. I am suffering and dealing problem within a month from the date of purchase. Go for a TFT screen.,2
"Ekart is very promt., but the display not dat much satisfactory., it has a heavy back light bleed., but overall its a good monitor., its not a great monitor for consoles but good for pc gaming., exterior built quLity is pretty good., and onboard audio out and menu controlling navigation is pretty much awesome.. i recomend it for pc gaming and watching movies",4
Very nice slim design makes perfect for slick looks and good gaminng experience as medium level gamer there is one drawback with this monitor and that is it only come with 1vga and 1 hdmi and no display port but as this one comes within my budget i won't be complaining very happy with the purchase,4
"STILL OBSERVING... BUT UNTILL NOW I AM HAPPY , VERY HAPPY FOR WHAT I HAVE GOT. PLAYED ASPHALT 9 LEGEND ON IT AND I AM LIKE WOOOSH!! GREAT DISPLAY FOR GAMING AND ALSO FOR OTHER WORKS...",5
1ms response time is just a marketing gimmick and this is a separate mode without freesync also doesn't work well. display is pretty good as it's ips if u r looking for gaming monitor then my advice is shell out 3k more and get higher refresh rate monitor VA panel This one ain't that of a gaming monitor from my experience.,4
The lighting and color of this monitor are not smooth to work for a long time. I think the mechanism of this monitor is made for LED tv. It is better for those persons who want to use this as LED tv.,3
Very nice monitor with crystal clear display. Best in its price range. I rate it 10/10. Amazing fast delivery by Flipkart too.,5
The delivery was quite fast. The monitor is best for the budget the clarity and the color is really good 75hz with HDMI,4

"Working fine so far, colors are also really accurate, a little over saturated, but I'd say 93-95% Response time seems to be on higher side I think 25-35ms need to confirm again.

Perfect monitor for WfH and multitasker .  No strain n eyes even after long usage.  I will advice keep blue light off (screen will become yellowish but need to take care of eyes first)and keep brightness at 20. It won't trouble your eyes,5

upsizing the monitor itself makes a huge difference and precisely this is why I took this 27 inch monitor after using 20 inch for a long time. following are pros and cons: pros: 1- colors are fairly accurate 2- bazels are thin 3- brightness and contrast pretty good  cons : 1- lack of speakers 2- hissing sound in earplug,5
Believe me its the best monitor...i have done a lot of research before buying. Monitor has very good color reproduction contrast and brightness. Picture quality is awesome that i love keep using my pc. No pixelation at all. First i though 1080p on 27inch will not enough but now i can say its enough. Panel is of very good quality.

Got a broken monitor completely waste of money,1
A must have for people who work on coding or your office work. You can have the screen tilted in any direction you like. You can get other monitors for cheaper price but make sure you get a stand like this.  The downside the cables which comes along with it are of no use. You won't be able to make it work with you laptop. I have a z book which has almost all the connectors available but the cables which comes along with this monitor doesn't work at all.,4
"Brought for 9899 Big Savings Day May 2021  Pros Highly adjustable stand. Bezel less 24"" good quality display Usb hub with 2 3.0 on side (use it for pendrive and all) and 2 2.0s on back side (connected ny keyboard and mouse to it) Cons (nitpicking ofcourse) No audio out No HDMI cable included No included speakers",5
"Pros: 1. Full HD (1920*1080) 2. Multiple connections (HDMI+VGA+DP) 3. Inbuilt USB 3.0 Hub (Can only be used when upstream/downstream cable is connected) 4. Adjustable Stand (Height+Orientation) 5. Dell Software known as DDM (Dell Display Manager). One can customize Brightness, Split Screen, View mode like comfort view etc. (Download it from Dell website)  Cons: 1. No HDMI cable is shipped along the monitor. 2. No headphone/audio out Jack.  Overall, one will love it. Thanks Dell and Flipkart.",5
"I recently purchased Dell 24inch P2419H product from flipkart. Product delivered within time. Packing and delivery was very good. Regarding monitor, it's very easy to install. We can adjust the height as well as tilt it or rotate based on our need. It's matt finish, which I prefer for long working hours. Only thing I do not understand for not providing HDMI cable along with monitor, one has to buy it separately if it's not already available. Otherwise it's very good product and worth for money.",5
"I got the deal @ 10.8k during sale. The monitor is a gem, I used the series from last 6 years in my office with mighty performance. So I decided go for it in my WFH setup. Everything works well as expected. Display is superb as usual.  I put 4 stars because of the accessories. 1. DP cable : only helps to connects with cpu or docking station. Useless for laptop. So i bought HDMI cable separate. 2. Power cable is big 16A plug. Not compatible for household sockets or ups.",4
"Really good quality product. But remember, you have to Calibrate it at the beginning, which is pretty easy too! Awesome build quality. Colour, Saturation & Sharpness is just the perfect!  Important Note: If connected over HDMI, change the default 'RGB' mode to 'YCbCr' to achieve an accurate blackness of the screen, resulting in to perfect Saturation.",5

Awesome display just replaced it with my old 768p monitor. It looks very premium with perfect sharpness and good colour reproduction. I use it mostly for gaming at 1080p with gtx 1060 6gb easily pulling 60 fps on most new games. One good advantage is that due to nvidia 's dsr super scaling and it being a 1080p monitor i can increase the resolution to 4k and all games support it. At 4k the display even though downsampled to 1080p looks just stunning but my gtx 1060 can not handle 4k. It can on... READ MORE,5

Super gaming monitor and quantum dot technology gives you more vivid colours. And the stand is the best thing about in this monitor. Perfect gaming monitor and also best for watching movies because of it's quantum dot technology. Viewing angle is awesome almost feels like IPS panel. Bought it for 22.2K during big billion day with SBI cards. And Flipkart does not give you service for installation just call a Samsung service number and installation will be done for free.,5

Best monitor in the price range. The display looks stunning. Curved display gives immerse viewing experience. Stand of monitor takes space bt gives you better flexibility. 144Hz in this price range is awesome.,5
Great monitor but the one i received had a stuck pixel on it and was very distracting. I requested a replacement and the response was great they sent a replacement very quickly and the new one doesnt have any dead pixels on it as of yet. Best 1440p monitor at this price. Thank you for the quick replacement.,4
The monitor is stunning...there are some reviews or complaints from users that the monitor stutters badly and comfortably runs on 120Hz for perfect output. But my monitor doesn't has that issue....i run all games on 1440p 144Hz without any problem. Also the picture quality a.k.a colour gamut is very nice in my opinion(I am not a professional editor mind you) but dont have any complaint.

Nice monitor with awesome clarity,5
Not the best of hd display. I have an LG ips 21.5 inch led monitor. Hd display of that better than this one. Couple of inches of screen size should not make this difference. May be the price is the reason because this costs less than the 21.5 inch one though the technical specs etc are all same.,3
Very good monitor. Using it for last 2 weeks for office work and it's actually awesome experience. You can also listen audio by connecting ur earphones. Wonderful product.,5
Took a risk and bought this product during lockdown. Flipkart delivered it right on time in excellent packaging. Wonderful service. Thank you. The IPS display with fast refresh rate is awesome.,5

superb crystal clear display... Thanks for the speedy delivery to flipkart. Need only few minutes to assemble and can be done. the only thing which bothers me is no height adjusting feature. you can't adjust it's high. It's a good purchase. No need to purchase separate HDMI out VGA cable. It's provided by the LG. thank you flipkart,4
"There were some gaps between screen and frame, and refresh rate doesnt go beyond 60hz.  Display is really vibrant and good color contrast.  Overall, a decent product",4
Ordered it for 12499 . overall the product is good but i had ordered it to use as CCTV as well as TV . Turns out sound is quite low ( 20W speaker). also saw Android tv for almost same price with better size ( 32 inch) for around 15 k.,3

Simply perfect üëå  It comes with HDMI and VGA cable as well.",5
"The monitor is a perfect combo of performance and price.  The viewing angles are great,the matt finish on the screen is a great plus to save our eyes from long hours of exposure to the screen,also there is seperate audio in and out ports which makes it easy to connect with external speakers via aux .  The only bummer for me was the lack of a headphone jack,which would have made it a perfect buy.",5
This moniter works very well because the min screen is too big. The moniter I.P.S panel is very good for having a viewing angle.......,5
"It's an awesome monitor , size is very good for using it on a table in front . Colours are good , 300 nits brightness makes it brighter , one more monitor I saw was of Acer that was of same specifications only difference was of brightness that was 250 nits brighter . Both having 75 Hz refresh rate . That's price of 8500 and this HP costed be 12600. I have no budget issues so I gone with HP . Because of brand reliability and 300 nits brightness.",5

Its color is not good as my 10 year old Benq 24inches VA panel monitor. Benq has more color depth. IPS panel monitor's Black color is also washed out compared to VA panels one. I have another IPS panel monitor from LG. Its color quality also same with this HP model. But overall for the price this monitor is worthy enough to watch film and gaming.,3
"Before ordering I though it would be bulky. But not. It's decent slim(not as slim as 22es). Vivid and crisp display. Got Power cable, Vga cable and HDMI cable within the box. Packing was excellent.",5

At first i got a damaged product but flipkart was fast in arranging a replacement. The replacement effort really increased my faith in online purchases. Thank you flipkart.

If you are looking for a big screen at a low price and ready to compromise a little on text quality go for it.,4
After all the research I found this product to be best and pocket friendly in the segment. I bought this for 9899/-. The screen quality is awesome. If you are searching for great picture quality in budget this product is for you.,5

Photo printing on glossy photo paper is too dark (blackish) even selecting phot paper selection and also very slow. But other printng is good and fast on normal paper even photos.

For the price of 1999 its a good deal. The printing is very slow. The copy and scan function works fine (good speed). Ink cartridge as usual are costly and one time purchase will sum up-to the printers cost.   The black ink cartridge won't even last 40 papers. Its showing low ink now. I am pretty sure color cartridge will be the same.,4

"Never buy an inkjet printer for any purpose coss these printers could not be returned if u are not satisfied by it. Cartridge provided with the printer consist of low ink hp calling it as trial purpose ,after 2-3 fillings u have to buy new cartridge as it declared useless by the printer. Cartridges filling is not good idea in these printers as it wastes half of it's ink duing every cleaning. Buy inktank as they are too efficient",1
Awesome product fast printing and scanning is also good and it is easy to setup but it is not wireless otherwise awesome,5
This product is good but the paper cost very high.. House Work is good but Business Work is Not Good..,3
Ink cartridge provided with it could not print even 60 black prints had to buy a refill ink .So if you have thought to buy remember to include the cost of the ink as well as the ink won't last long well the print quality is appreciable and good enough for home use .,3

Satisfied with the printer. Color page cost I am not sure as Canon claims but I have yet to check it. Black ink for sure works quite well.

Color print quality is good though the color seems to fade away in few months (can be because i kept the photos in open stick to my refrigerator or the paper quality might not be really good.),5

Photo printing on glossy photo paper is too dark (blackish) even selecting phot paper selection and also very slow. But other printng is good and fast on normal paper even photos. Instalation is easy. Wify function is too good. Printing from the mobil app is also very easy to use. Do no purchase for photograph printing purpose.,5

"Very nice printer, is worth the purchase. Ideal for Home printing but the black cartridge prints hardly 100 Pages and same with Color cartridge.The cartridge price is costly so I suggest you to Buy GoColor Canon compatible ink's each bottle is of 100 ML and you will find that there's is difference between Original and GoColor ink's.

"Looks great but it was very delicate piece nd also careful with plugin points as they are sensitive, overall it is best for home printers. Doesn't have bluetooth or wifi connection only works through cable. Printed nicely and easy to print.",4
For the price of 1999 its a good deal. The printing is very slow. The copy and scan function works fine (good speed). Ink cartridge as usual are costly and one time purchase will sum up-to the printers cost.   The black ink cartridge won't even last 40 papers. Its showing low ink now. I am pretty sure color cartridge will be the same.,4

Basic printing can be done, good for people working from home can take printouts of txt documents.

"i have 4 laser printers of HP. Sometimes the sleeve, roller or something or the other is not working properly and the maintenance guys mostly cheat you by replacing parts and not refilling the ink properly. Here this EPSON works very fine, no roller, no drum and no cartridge. Put a bottle of ink in a tank and you are done for next 6000 prints. once a year call the maintenance guy from the company @ Rs400 per visit and all works fine. My photocopy bill has been reduced considerably now",4

One of the best printers in the market. i am using this for past 4 months now. The photo prints are amazing with virtually no cost at all. All persons criticising the product need to Rethink. Strongly recommended for everyone. No printer can be compared to this cost effective product. Amazing.,5
"I have give 3 star for 1st for Fast delivery and good behavior of shipment master. 2nd star for easy to use and print 3rd star for ADF technology.

First brother don't offer free installation for online purchases(only telephonic assistance) which does not justify customer values. Although installation is easy. After connecting to my pc with USB and wifi it prints slowly: but after installation of brother drivers it works very fast(but not as fast as cartridge inkjet printers). One more thing I notice is that color print is much faster than monochrome print. Photo prints are very nice. Problem. I have face is black is not bla... READ MORE,4
Best print quality with this price,5
Easy to use... Hassel free. Just missing automatic duplex printing else perfect,4
So far so good. Print quality is awesome. Print speed for photo print in best quality is slow. Connects well to wifi.  Pros: 1 Easy to install 2. Economical 3. Paper tray is great. Cons : finding original replacment ink online is confusing and a bit difficult too.,5
Good printer.,5
Bit slow with WiFi but connects fast takes time only for first time connection.,4

Print quality as black and white is excilent Costing seems to be really good both running and buying Compared to hP range prints are slower but u tend to over look that with the print quality The paper tray hold less paper compared to a flat bed tray hence if u print a lot u need to refil many times.

"Anyone buying an Epson Product , must first speak to someone who has purchased an Epson Printer, and then suffered due to lack of availability of Epson cartridges.

"A premium and smart multifunctional printer. I especially bought it for its paper tray remains inside unlike other brands with WiFi.. At home, once paper tray is loaded, forget it. Its WiFi feature is bit tricky to work with... though it can be easily set up using usb cable and cd option which appears only after it fails to connect WiFi without cable. It works fine for all its functions. It's compact but bit heavy for home. I'm very happy to have it especially with discounted price.",5

"For a home based use its a best product. Very compatible for daily printing. Nd don't buy hp original cartridge bcoz its very costly, use turbo refill kit to rrfill your original cartridge which is free with your printer purchase. Overall it's a best.  Superb",5
Printer is very good for home use. It is light and is easy to set up and operate. ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE COST OF COMPATIBLE CARTRIDGE HP 803 which is very expensive. A combo of black and multicolor HP 803 cartridges will cost you around ‚Çπ1500/- (for 2 cartridges) which is more than half of the cost of this printer. Hence i didn't give 5 star rating.,3
awesome printer... easy to use.. but the original ink cartridge is very costly about RS 700 black and RS 800 to 900 colour ink .. but the local ink refile is very cheaper about Rs150 to 200 per bottle .. U can reuse of of ink cartridge.. by refile.... many vedios on YouTube to explain how can local ink used in hp ink cartridge .. by the printer is very good... I loved this printer...,5

Onr of the best printer smooth functioning and amazing look i am very happy with the product and even with after sales,5
Printing quality is not too clear to praise. Paper tray(input) seems to be slightly jammy but operates flawless when bundled with at least ten pages at a time. Cost effective for home purpose or school projects.,4
"Been using this for over a month now.the biggest advantage is no more ink spills and more economic than normal inkjet ones. But the only problem is that the paper tray that holds the paper is shorter than the paper size, which bends the paper slightly at the top end.now when we use this paper to print on the other side, it causes paper jam.so what I do is I insert the paper on the tray just before printing anything . Hp could do something to improve this. Otherwise everything is perfect.",4
Very Good Printer for Home Use & easy to install. Print quality is at par and with the ink quantity you are sure to take many printouts in one refill. Compact design of this device doesn't need much space to place it and use it.,5
Worth buying. Fast delivery by Flipkart. Easy to installed. Good quality printing.,5

"A good functional printer. You get ink bottles in the package and the inks are to be filled into containers in the printer. If you follow the instructions, it is very simple to fill the inks.

Its and awesome printer and very easy to operate. Some comments i read below are about the cost of original hp ink. To cut down the cost of bulk printing you can use GoColour ink to refill the cartridge and it yeilds good quality print not as much good as original ink. But take a print every 5-7 day after refilling otherwise ink will dry up. In short its a good quality printer at very low cost.,5

Hope you like the review ! You can go for it !! :),4
Its a very good printer at this price range. Printing Quality is very good with really great printing speed. Photo copy features and Scan also works well. It comes with 2 Catrigdes (1 black and 1 color) along with the Installation CD. Installation is very simple you just need to run the set up and follow the on-screen instructions. I got the installation CD for HP2130 but it worked perfectly fine for 2135. So far this has been giving a good service.,4

"When I started looking for ink tank printer brother printer was not even remotely in my mind. I was comparing between Epson and Canon models. In India Epson has 46%+ market share in ink tank printer category.

"It is really sad to say that the approach of the Flipkart team has been very harassing and unsupportive. Once your product will start performing not well, even in the Replacement/warranty period, then they will not provide a solution and try to trap you through rules and regulations. You will be harassed at that level where you will give up to contact the team. You will be only responsible for your purchased item, not Flipkart.  #PURCHASE PRODUCT AT OWN RISK  #NOT RECOMMENDED",1

Thanks to Epson for bringing in Ink Tank Printers. Prior to this we were being looted by so called original Ink cartridge companies or we had to use Laser printers.

Epson L220 multifunction printer has all the functions that a professional printer would have and is working like charm. It is very silent and there is very less vibration from the machine itself. This is just my 2 nd day of use. So I could not have enough time to know and review it. It relieved me from going to xerox shops for print outs as well as run for a scanner at times of need. Liked the product very much.,5

B/W print is very good. Text comes out really sharp. 2. Scanned images and documents retain excellent detail when zoomed in. 3. Setup process is very easy. Also I'd recommend you to download drivers from HP website since the bundled CD contains outdated software. 4. THE PRICE is the best thing about t... READ MORE",4

Its and awesome printer and very easy to operate. Some comments i read below are about the cost of original hp ink. To cut down the cost of bulk printing you can use GoColour ink to refill the cartridge and it yeilds good quality print not as much good as original ink. But take a print every 5-7 day after refilling otherwise ink will dry up. In short its a good quality printer at very low cost.,5

It is a nice printer. i bought it at just Rs 3699 . on sale. Its good but the xerox is not as good as was expected. the cartridges are too small. But overall the prints are excellent and processing at a fast rate. Nice speed ! It is perfect for home and small office . not reccommended for big offices . It is not very big but user friendly .  Hope you like the review ! You can go for it !! :),4
Its a very good printer at this price range. Printing Quality is very good with really great printing speed. Photo copy features and Scan also works well. It comes with 2 Catrigdes (1 black and 1 color) along with the Installation CD. Installation is very simple you just need to run the set up and follow the on-screen instructions. I got the installation CD for HP2130 but it worked perfectly fine for 2135. So far this has been giving a good service.,4

HP 4535 is a very good option for home use. The printer is sturdy and has a simple design. 1. It's easy to setup with the WiFi too. 2. Has eprint using hp service plugin or through the eprint app. 3. The printer has an unique email I'd too. Tested all the three and found working fine. Haven't tested the quiet mode. The paper tray is well designed and can hold 30 sheets easily. I had a hp psc 1315 so took another hp.  Design-4/5 Performance-5/5(it has everything you need for the price).,4
It's perfect for school homework and office printing. The wifi feature is the best. I can print directly from my iPhone or android device.  I just ran out of ink in my catrige. Cost of replacement for couloir is around rs. 580/- it took about 6 months to empty with my printing levels  I highly recommend this.,5

Not good too low quality of paper,1
The product was delivered within 6 days and also the packaging was also nice and satisfactory but the pricing for the cartridge is very high which could have been priced bit lower around 1200 Rs and the package was just wrapped in newspapers and only one small piece of cardboard but the package was firm and fair enough for its safety,4
Very Bad product... Maximum 20 pages printed per cartridge,1
Hey everyone... I bought a pack of these colors from this seller on flip kart and it was actually a big mistake to not buy from the seller I always buy... And all this just to get a cheaper deal. The cartridges finished after printing exactly 18 sheets... Yes 18. Immediately I checked for the genuine mark on the box and it was also there.... So I don't know what to say to flip kart. I just hope such sellers aren't allowed to do business on online shops such as flip kart and these things shoul... READ MORE,1

The dates and mrp were scratched so couldn't check the price. I would suggest to buy from local market if accessible, it will definitely be cheaper.  Ink: Have used the same bottle before so can say that ink is good. If u use ur cartridge on regular bases then u will have no issues. Happy printing !!",3
This ink is of excellent quality at par as the original one. If you fill ink properly in your cartridge taking proper measures it will 100% work.,5
"I bought this from Cartwick - seller. I just refilled my HP 802 cartridge with this and wow!! the print quality is so good!!. Although it took a week to get it delivered in Mumbai, but the wait was worth it. The packaging was perfect and ekart delivered it as promised in 7 working days. ThankYou Prodot Thank you Cartwick :-)",5
Cheaper than all sellers...delivery takes time but not matters a lot because i want the product at minimum prize...one suggestion plz prefer packing in cardboard...its better suited..,5
"V. good. It is upgrade version of original ""Prodot"" named ""PROLITE"". You can see the original ""Prodot"" name in right side with glossy Silver sticker. And My best Experience is: the ink is very current manufacture on 09/2018 (today is 12/10/2018). 10000000% best seller. every body should trust and buy from here...",5

Totally worth every penny. The offer to avail 3 black ink cartridges (Large size) which normally gives 400 printouts for just Rs. 2804/-. Local HP stores charge MRP prices which are too steep. Amazing offer if its still on kindly avail of it !!!,5
"This product will not disappoint in terms of print quality, but the quantity of pages it can print is very low compared to the price. Although it says that it can print up to 360 pages, but it hardly has crossed the 150 mark. But above everything, amazing delivery service by Flipkart, got free one-day delivery and also the price is the best one can expect. It is definitely cheaper than any local shop. So go for it if you want good quality print.",4
Color consumption is very high due to which cartridges finish up quickly as expected. But the product is nice easy to install and ready to use.,4
The product deliver was well packed and within time. Price is good and same the product is. original product and good printing quality and quantity.,5
"Always good the HP products,not sure about its page yield because I am still using it. If it fulfills the promise of number pages then it is a good buy. But I recommend to use original products.",4
"Just a quick mention on the printers compatible with this cartridge: I have an HP J110 Inkjet Printer (also bought from Flipkart). The printer came with small HP 802 black and tricolour cartridges, which got over pretty quickly. If you have this printer and are wondering if you could use the large HP 802 cartridges instead, the answer is YES! While I'm quite impressed with my printer, I'm not so impressed with the page yields offered by these cartridges.",3
"Shipment as usual was super quick from flipkart. Packing was normal. and it prints fine. The manufacturing date mentioned on the cartridge is June'12, which is good to have a fresh ink. Expiry runs thru 2014. I have used these carts before and the definitely it does not print the number of pages it promises. Much less then that. Quality of printouts is good but the as I said before, the page yield is less. I guess that is something to do with the software also, it does not allow you to print ... READ MORE",4
"The same cartridge if you take from market or authorized HP outlets it will cost you Rs.950- Rs.1000. So its better to use the advantage of Flipcart. It costs me less and it has been delivered in the next day at my doorstep. Even in most of the outlet HP 802 Large cartridge are not freely available. So its better to get it from flipcart through spending 1 min in net, rather than roaming around the city. And if you looking for quality printing use HP Deskjet printer with original HP cartridges",5

Came wrapped in a cardboard not even proper box. Price was erased of the package. Another thing is that product is prolite but it does have like a hologram of prodot",3
"Ink quality is GOOD. Quick to dry, smudge free and water resist. Present cap is good to prevent ink spill in transit. Supplier should consider including separate nozzle caps for each bottle or one 10 ml syringe to facilitate easy refilling.",5

The product is available in local market in just half of this price. Price wise not a good decision to purchase it online from any of the shopping site. Notwithstanding purchasing canon printers and peripherals are not economical at all.,1
The worst cartridge which finished even before taking a printout of 50 copies do not at all buy this one. Best go to canon showroom,1
"It's a waste product. An ink cartridge costing nearly Rs.1000/- hardly gave 15-20 A4 prints & now it's ink has vanished showing "" ink level low"" making print extraordinary costlier. It's a waste product from canon. I suggest don't buy the printer itself whose cartridge is costlier than the printer itself.",1

Regarding the Canon product, I have been buying standard size which is 8ml supposed to give 180 pages marketed. but when I tracked last 3 replacement it's been between 60-120 range. I realize now how this works. So as Canon says for 8ml size it's 180 pages and it means it's the max it can print on continous printing (which is replacing cartridge and printing documents without images on single run ) should give around 150-180 pages. but if ...

Earlier the inks, colour or black, were affordable, in the sense that the number of copies I could get printed were more than what I am getting now for the same price.

As the demand for inks is going up, I personally would like the price of inks to come down and get more copies printed for the same price. This wil... READ MORE",5

A perfect mate for all HP deskjet printers !! Works well with all HP printers and gives a long printing life when used for moderate printing use. Heavy printing depletes the cartridge very fast. Excellent Buy for sparing use.,5
"I guess the cartridge never prints the promised number of pages, because the ink gets dried very quickly. This is probably due to hot climate of our country. HP must have designed them for Air Conditioned; cool offices and homes of the US.",1
"Gives only 50-60 pages max (all text with minimal graphics). Don't blame the cartridge - blame the printer model! Absolute waste of money!!!  Instead, you can but the larger cartridge that promises 360 pages. It actually gives 200-250 pages.",2
The cartridge is very good in quality and colour perfectly compatible for my printer good product...,5
Very good product . It gives near to same quality what we have in HP original cartridge. Technical support also good for printing issues if any. Over all its a good product in this price . Thank you.,5

i use this cartridge for everyday printing as well as photo printing. i was amazed by the quality of photos on photopaper(best quality)...also black ink cartridge gives over 380~420 prints on fast draft quality(black in only)...usually the colored cartridge last for 80~120 prints normal quality....its quite a good product..,4
"Timely delivery and nicely packed from Flipkart. Good product from HP.  However, I would have appreciated if Flipkart has some mechanism to collect the old cartridge and either return to HP for re-fill or to some reputed recycler!",4
Even though i made payment via internet banking yet the product delivered to me very next day to the date of order. Such kind of good service we cant expect from stores like snapdeal. if we made payment to them in advance they either does not ship product in time or not deliver at all. It is only flipkart from which such kind of good service can be expected,5
"I am using this with my HP InkJet 2545 printer.. Offers excellent value for money prints.  I have the default settings set as draft mode (lowest quality) as I dont see much of quality difference between Best / Normal / Draft mode with my usage (mainly office job, text and such docs with very little picture).  Draft mode allows really fast printing, as fast as leserjet with acceptable quality. But biggest advantage is the number of pages as I see. It goes close to 800 to 900 pages for me.  Wit...

sound wise its ok product.. 4 speaker produce very less sound.. bass is ok (not much).  It can be good for small room but definitely not for hall. I didn't feel thrilling while watching movie on tv with this sound.  The only thing which impressed is bluethooth connectivity.,3

It has excellent bass management, be it beats of drums or that of Tablas. It has a warm sound sugnature that is difficult to achieve at such a price.  It has an unique feature developed by F&D that allows you to change folders in which you have kept your audio files inserted via USB Flash Drive or SD Card. It can remember yourlast device and wil...

"Loud sound,awesome sound quality and awesome Bass.Good controls as you can control each speaker and sw individually.Sound output not that much good when connected through Aux to TV.May be for TV optical cable must be used or any other way.Even on high volume it doesn't get distorted, even the dialogues and voice of the singer are very clear instead of high bass,so very good experience of both.Very good home theatre tbh.",4
"wow ....wow wow.. high bass , design and style was awsame . speaker connection wire was good .and many more when you buy this product and enjoy the sound system.",5
work as expected but main issue is with optical port. it doesn't support 5.1 digital audio with optical cable. i tried to contact customer support so many times to clear this but didnt got satisfactory reply.,2
Great system for the price. The USP is the woofer. Satellite speakers are average if you are connecting it to a Aux cable. But you will get better results using optical port but doesn't support 5.1 surround from PS3 or 4. This converts 2.1 to 5.1 using in built Prologic system which is decent but won't get actual individual surround sound to each speaker.,4
It's A Super Home Theater system..with Good Bass Quality...No Distortion..Nd Very Good Build quality... Specially the wires provided with the speaker's are surprisingly long enough to install a proper 5.1 stereo System :),5
"Best home theatre. Awesome bass. Big subwoofer. Because of small extra treble speakers, treble sound is good. Better than philips. Sound details are good. Control from fenda app is easy. System remembering previous settings even after power off on is good feature.  Turn on 5.1 from remote. Sound beast.",5
F6000x is just great with the sound system in balance. It has incredible bass. the volumes for all the channels can be controlled by remote & the fenda app which can be downloaded from playstore. The app is also awesome you can control almost eveything from the app installed on your mobile. One feature the app lacks is the mute and power on/off option. I am using this for editing audio files as well as watching movies and in my opinion the sound produced by this system is just well balanced. ... READ MORE,4
Sound coming from this product is good . Bass is good . But not deep bass. Works all connectivity . Hdmi arc is missing. Value for money I bought for 8300 in offer. For this price its working good.. cannot expect like Yamaha,5
"Pros: Optical Cable connectivity is good, Bass is amazing since it's an Active / powered subwoofer Treble is good enough Loudness is adequate  Cons: No option / provision to control the treble No Dolby support Price keeps increasing",5
"Got a deal for Rs 8099. Bass quality is unbeatable for the price. Subwoofer is slightly bigger is size compared to pictures shown. Looks wise it's great, nice black finishing.  It's money well spent.",5
Good product Nice Bass full nice Ok product country manufacturing country origin Indonesia making good quality achcha best best quality is good,5
"good sound quality when you adjust equalizer externally from mobile or PC, enough option for daily user like bt,aux,and portable audio, with bass control, and most important is its not made in China ,it s made in Indonesia by lg good product blindly go for it",5
"As expected sound quality is excellent with great bass effect. But there is something I personally not liked about it considering that even speakers with a price tag of ‚Çπ1000 or so on have that feature. ( When playing from USB after power off it always start playing 1st song, means it doesn't start playing from your last played track)",4
"Don't lose interest by its boxy look. It's an awesome purchase at its price. Sound quality is great. It has so many features at this price point, I especially loved the adjustable bass at this price point from a reputed manufacturer. It doesn't have great aesthetics with those flashy lights but it's a terrific purchase.",5
Nice XBOOM..... Sound quality is so good with nice bass But its volume can be more loud...... But is OK,4
bass is too good at this rate.. sound also good ..... good product by LG. Thanks,5
"Excellent product. Listening to sings is a bliss in this one. Be it high volume or low volume, or melody or bass high songs it simply rocks. However I found that while watching movies the dialogue is not that audible compared to the bass sound. So I won't say sound quality is excellent. For movies it is not that good.The bgm sound is high and voice is low hence it is not good to hear the dilaogues properly. But as I said for songs both the music and sound is good.",4
"The product is delivered on time. Packing etc. is satisfactory. After unboxing the product, spared no time to connect it as per instructions provided in the literature. Function key allows one to choose among the input options like USB, Bluetooth etc. Bluetooth pairing is fast and smooth. Sound quality is quite nice and soothing as expected from a 40w system.

Speakers are good but it needs three 3.5 mm jack to rca port to have that 5.1 CH effect on PC or DVD subwoofers not best but its good at this price There is a cons The rear speaker wire length is not much longer even for short room but over all it's decent speakers at this price,4
"Bought this product from vijay sales, this is just Awsome, people who love bass explode will love it, although the overall sound is best in its class. It is best suitable for home theater as well The best part is this system is very easy to use, no rigidity in connecting wires Bluetooth is quick to connect with your phone & quality is Awsome Radio also works well It plays usb drive as well & there is micro USB card also which I haven't tried",5

it has good Cristal clear soung with good thumping bass.but it also have some limitations..the build quality is good but the way woofer is installed with simple screw is not good..high bass slowly could loose the screw.it could be more better.. And the second con is that if u go 70% plus volume with high bass then voice get distorted.but about 60% to 50% volume it sounds better with good bass..if u place the all satelite speaker and woofer in proper place as mentioned in user installation m...

The bass was overpowering other tones. If i wanted to hear the vocals, i had to turn the volume way up. But then at higher volume the bass too increases and then vocals and tweeter is almost not audible. For a better sounf exp, i bought RT-40  When i switched on RT-40, i was impressed with the cl...

Best Home Theater in this range. If you are in a tight budget just go for it you will not regret in your decision. I am very happy. And with the help of Sony Music Center App you can control this beautiful home theater with you Smart phone.,5
"Really nice set of speakers, setting was a bit complex, especially the tall boy speakers, but it was fun. Sound quality is quite good and clear. Bass is a bit on the lower side, but that's fine, if you want crystal clear voice.",5
"Pros : Looks wise product is awesome. Sound quality is good. Tower speakers are awesome, delivers awesome sound.  Cons: You hardly fee Bass effect, very very bad on bass part, too low.  Sound bar dominates over output and you have no controls to reduce the sound on sound bar, it irritates you for sure. My overall rating would be 1.5",2

If you looking for home theater for a small or medium size room and have low budget then this product is suitable for that. If love to listen songs with great bass then this product is not for you. Surround sound is very good vocal is clear. For movie lovers this product is perfect. If you have high budget then go for some other product. With high bass sound is destroyed. With low bass sound is so perfect.,3
"Amazing product from Motorola. First of all , very hard to find a Home theatre system with Surround speakers + Soundbar, as most 5.1 speakers are 5 individual units with lot of messy wiring  Packaging was great and product is easy to set up in less than 5 min  Coming to audio quality, it all depends on how well you place the speakers and the Individual volumes you set for each speaker .

"Bought this for dad but for folks conscious about sound quality, this is a BIG NO. Even a mid range Android phone will beat this on sound quality grounds. Collection of songs is good and it is responsive from navigating the controls perspective. Looks good but green colour does not give an authentic vintage look that you get from wood colour versions.  Overall at this price range you don't get good sound quality which is a deal breaker.",2

Good product in this price range.bass and sound clarity is good.it's better than sony d-40 . Sony also good product but no bass and treble control in that product.panasonic is better choice.,5
After a month long research with the price constraint and the expectations i had i settled for Panasonic 4.1 HT . I wanted the Bluetooth and remote functions but with a established brand name. Have used Panasonic TV multiple models for over a decade. The speakers are worth the money. The base kicks in pretty good. For a living room of 13x15 this would be a great buy. Make sure you place the speakers well and at the prescribed places. The sound quality and bass effect are worth the money.,4

Note: if you have a small room you want to install the system in, go for this because of controls. Sony has got loud bass which will probably be more of an issue than experience for small rooms. Choose wisely !",5
This home theatre sound system is so Excellent good quality of sound clearly hear,5
"Crisp and clear Sound clarity. Notes are clear, Beats are clearly Audible. Bass is unbalanced, Even if i adjust the base, then also its not doing justice to the song. there is this humming base. Honestly I am not enhanced base lover but at least the required amount of base should be produced. I can compromise with amount of base produced but not the quality of the base. It should be punchy which is not there in this speaker system. Overall, speaker is good for a medium sized room. I feel it s... READ MORE",4

"A quality product as expected from Sony.. I was quite surprised to see a huge box delivered, since I was expecting something compact.. Turned out the speakers are indeed compact but its the woofer that's massive.. Be prepared to dedicate quite some space for them.. The audio quality is excellent.. I'm taking away two stars because the bass is quite extreme, and there is no physical control to reduce it. I had to adjust equalizer settings on my phone to reduce bass. Connectivity is excellent ... READ MORE",3
In single word it's a magic . sony only provide this type of sound . fantastic delivery by flipcart . no option for bass and treble manual control. you don't want it after hearing it's balanced sound . every thing is perfectly balanced. go for it bliendly if 6999 is ur budget . otherwise go for any product ABCD AS U WISH,5
Good design and build quality Clarity also good but this two satellite speakers is not enough to give you perfect voice clarity while you watching movies..,4
These speakers are NOT for general home use. These can be used in club or any restaurants with large space. The main problem with them no manual BASS control. For general tv viewing these becomes unbearable with too much forward bass. BASS is tuned in groove mode. In home it can only used for music in low volume. Overall clarity is above average. NO volume control on speakers or it remembers old volume settings. So keep remote safely. I think sony should listen to users or chinese companies... READ MORE,3
"Don't listen to the negetive reviews, they all have biased opinions. If u want a good system for your led tv/computer don't look any further, just go n grab this for 6.5k. Center is muffled though but cat expect it should sound like 25k system. It is bank on bucks. Under 7k it is the best money can get.",5
sounds quality Good clear sound but Bass not so good just better all over good speaker from Sony go for it,4
"Excellent speakers. Superb bass. This speaker is specifically for people who like thump and groove in their music. If you're expecting to use it for normal use (with TV or for soft music),then this isn't the thing you'd like to buy. The speakers are accompanied by a remote control for power on/off, volume control, changing operation mode and controlling playback via USB. No volume control on the speakers, a bass control option could have let the speakers be used for general purpose too. Ever... READ MORE",5
I have Sennheisar headphone. That really ptoduces a rich quality of sound. That has super bass too. Bu the bass of sony SA-D20 is irritating. Doesn't have bass or body control. I prefer to return the product if it were possible. Sound distortion is common at higher volume. This is not at all upto the mark as the brand is Sony. I'm not satisfied for its sound balance. Bass lover may find it satisfactory.,2
Actually it has the av connector nd my tv has the HDMI ARC 2 ND OPTICAL supporter i am confused how to connect .. 1. connect through Bluetooth of Home theatre nd Tv  2. i buyed the AmazonBasics Digital Optical Coax to Analog RCA Audio Converter Adapter with Fiber Cable with that av connector i put it in RCA audio connector nd passee the optical wire from audio connector to TV now its sounds good...

"I was confused with bass but after buying fully satisfied with it. great bass and sound with great looks but few things are missing like no digital optical sound port, no hdmi arc port bluetooth is 4.2 not 5.0 for those who are facing problem like only two speakers are working or 2.1 only and want to use all 5.1 speakers there is button on remote name sound press and change to 5.1 but for surround sound you need to use dvd ports.",5
After 15 months of use Pros- 1 loud 2 bass is powerful Cons 1 sound quality not so good 2 bass is strong but not pleasant  Conclusion For party music it is great But i don't recommend it for regular music/slow / romantic songs AGAR KHAREEDNA HAI KHARRED LO ITNA BURA NAHI HAI BUT DAILY SUNNE LAYAK NAHI HAI,4

Speakers are good but it needs three 3.5 mm jack to rca port to have that 5.1 CH effect on PC or DVD subwoofers not best but its good at this price There is a cons The rear speaker wire length is not much longer even for short room but over all it's decent speakers at this price,4
"Bought this product from vijay sales, this is just Awsome, people who love bass explode will love it, although the overall sound is best in its class. It is best suitable for home theater as well The best part is this system is very easy to use, no rigidity in connecting wires Bluetooth is quick to connect with your phone & quality is Awsome Radio also works well It plays usb drive as well & there is micro USB card also which I haven't tried",5

it has good Cristal clear soung with good thumping bass.but it also have some limitations..the build quality is good but the way woofer is installed with simple screw is not good..high bass slowly could loose the screw.it could be more better..

Excellent product from boat. Was in search of right soundbar for almost 15 days. Finally bought boat 2000 160 watts for good reviews in the market which didn't disappoint me.

Got this for 3800.  Using them with my desktop for the 5.1 surround experience and also on Bluetooth on other devices.  The sound and bass both are fine and powerful.  Bluetooth sucks pretty much on alll speakers so does on this too. Even my other two Bluetooth speakers suffer from the same issue.  The speaker don't have wall mount holes. So kinda a big deal as the surround satellite can't be hung on the wall without going through too much hassle.  The mute and input/output change animation ... READ MORE,4

Speakers are good but it needs three 3.5 mm jack to rca port to have that 5.1 CH effect on PC or DVD subwoofers not best but its good at this price There is a cons The rear speaker wire length is not much longer even for short room but over all it's decent speakers at this price,4
"Bought this product from vijay sales, this is just Awsome, people who love bass explode will love it, although the overall sound is best in its class. It is best suitable for home theater as well The best part is this system is very easy to use, no rigidity in connecting wires Bluetooth is quick to connect with your phone & quality is Awsome Radio also works well It plays usb drive as well & there is micro USB card also which I haven't tried",5

it has good Cristal clear soung with good thumping bass.but it also have some limitations..the build quality is good but the way woofer is installed with simple screw is not good..high bass slowly could loose the screw.it could be more better.. And the second con is that if u go 70% plus volume with high bass then voice get distorted.but about 60% to 50% volume it sounds better with good bass..if u place the all satelite speaker and woofer in proper place as mentioned in user installation m...

Good product from philips. Pros- Base is too strong. Sound clarity also good. Plus point acts as both sound bar and tower speaker. Plays well on bluetooth and optic cable. build quality is premium. better sound and solid base. Better than boat avante.  Cons - speaker sometimes produces humming noise. Secondly got a damaged product at first but flipkart replaced it within 2 days. No hdmi support.,4

"Sound quality and bass are excellent. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless. It is hard to believe that the speaker has max. output of 35 W, feels like more than 50 W. There is bass control which is really helpful. Look wise there is a small glitch, there is no volume display. While increasing the volume by remote, a LED blinks with each increment so when the LED light stops blinking it means maximum volume is reached. Usually maximum volume is marked as 30 in F&D, from that point if you decrea... READ MORE",5

As I have edifier bookshelf speaker which I have connected with my Sony LED TV. And sounds awesome. But it has little less in bass. So l have added only it's subwoofer for bass depth. And now watching movies is like in theatre. Everything is fine about this home theatre except it does not remember the last volume settings. When you turn off it will go to defult volume which is very high. Bass is good even in low volume.,5

1. Built up and design is good. 2. Sound is good. 3. Bass is good. 4. Only stereo effect is not upto expecations. 5. Bass lovers can purchase. 6. Stereo lovers may think before purchase.,4

Ultima sound n bass I like it,5
All good but Bluetooth range is little bit low and fluctuations happened.,3
Awesome experience... Next level sound quality and bass... Must buy. üëç But the only disappointing facts are... The blutooth range is little bit of short and the LED light isn't rhythmic,5
Good quality,4

"I am looking forward for a speaker which I can use with my PC as well as with TV in my bedroom I close my search on Creative Stage Air . Audio quality is excellent at this price. I have tested it in deep and found it awesome. This product is just like a shrunk down version of your TV soundbar and sounds just as good in a smaller package.

Awesome Home Audio Speaker by Blaupunkt Cons: HDMI port not available on the device. Delivery not available for Thane. That's why order placed at Gurgaon (Uncle's) address & from there privately couriered to Thane Worth every penny.,5
OK product. I got this in 6300. Remote quality is pathetic so my rating is 3 star. Remotes works on a battery type which normally uses in wrist watch. Good features are amazing sound quality and easy buletooth paring with mobile phones. It is not wall mountable and bit heavy too. There is no FM in this product.

Clutter free TV audio experience. It serves its purpose well. One will not regret on his purChase. It's just an upgradation to a cheap audio quality that comes with any/all TV sets. Don't expect anything great with 45 watt rms output without a tweeter and range between 50 Hz to 19 KHz in real terms. I am happy with my purchase...!,5

"The sound clarity is top notched. A very good sound system in this price range. People are giving less stars most probably because of the woofer output. But trust me it gives a very well balanced bass. Its a 300 w machine all together and Bass is quite heavy as per the power output.

I personally suggest creative speakers to persons who loves the depth and quality of sound.The build quality of the product is excellent. perfect bass and crispy sounds. If u are looking for 5.1 surroundings for your PC then you should also add a 5.1 sound card to get a 6 channel output.,5

Some people say that other satellite speakers doesn't work but it is the 5.1 channel.It comes in 3 aux,green for front speakers, black for rear speakers and orange for middle.You have to buy a aux splitter to connect them at one or if you want 5.1 channel experience connect them as per your computer or dvd player..but the sound produced is of little high pitch and there is no pump in bass",4

If you are listening to any music you have to continuously change bass and treble after every song....

best product within the range awesome Bass quality and sound beautifully designed I just loved it,5

It is because of woofer position. Woofer position should not at center. Woofer produces bass surrond but not in front. Place a woofer at left or... READ MORE",5
Superb Build Quality and Sound Quality is Just awesome little bit Costly but if you have budget then no one is better than Sony as they have excellency in LED TV an Sound System..Most Recommended Product..Go for it..,5
Sound is clear even when two fans are running on full speed.... I am not sure if it will work it very large rooms... It works perfectly in my room (155sqf)..but it occasionally detaches itself from TV and goes on stand-by but that's not a major issue... Sound and bass is impressive... Bluetooth connectivity is quick and sound production is as good as wired connection. Remote control is very simple and easy.,4
Pros: Sub woofer has great punch. Clear sound. Good price. If you r Looking for sound bar and home theater this is a valuable pick. Cons: If u r a sound lover go for home theater from yamha onkyo etc. This doesnt support dts which most of the blu ray disk is released. You dont really experince 5.1 channel sound since center and front speakers comes in single bar. This is a 5.1 home theater just for name sake. Its purely a sound bar with subwoofer,3
"Awesome sound... crisp and clear... bass also really good and punchy after I bought extra sound mixer cost of 2k having Bluetooth connectivity. Sony don't give a individual bass and high adjustment. it is having only presetted equalizer. Now I can adjust bass and high, even you can connect mic, or musical instruments. Just enjoying the 600w output fully afterwards. I'm fully satisfied. Only had problem with delivery. Not recommended Delhivery parcel service.",5
Very poor service from flipkart and their courier partner blue dart. Order delayed by 8 days With no reason. Coming to the product. A brilliant system from Sony. Sound is crisp and clear. Max volume is 50 but 25 is more than enough for an average room. Bass can be felt at a distance. Overall a good product and value for money.,5
"Excellent product by Sony..Istallation is done by self..I informed Sony Cust Care and they also take the request but did not send any service engineer for demo and installation..So I did myself by local electrician..Sound Quality is Superb,Crystal clear and bass is also superb..Built quality is also good..I brought this at 15200/- during independence day sale on flipcart..which is very economic..no such showroom offer me in this price..So I give 5/5..EXCELLENT PRODUCT BY SONY AND THANKS TO FL...

"None of the other brands offer 3.1 + 2 seperate speakers. Been three months purchased this product, after going through a slew of other music systems.. The voice clarity is a bit to worry although you get an option to amplify the voice. The bass is good for the price point. Overall, anyone who desires a reliable branded product within budget, can choose this blindly.",4
The product is really worth having it with punchy sound as mentioned very easy to assemble connect to smart TV without any hassel one awesome product and flipkart your always as perfect packaging everting was good second day delivery thanks,5
Sony home theatres and well known for their sound quality and this one is no different have good punch and details.. sorround speakers wires have good length.. if you want full surround experience u have to connect through hdmi... totally satisfied with the product and delivery by flipkart..,5
"Before I start my review I like to thank Flipkart for timely delivery of the product.I heartily says Flipkart rocks. Now regarding the product only little bit treble sound is less ,otherwise everything is ok,one more thing no optical input. l added tweeters to all the five speakers and my treble problem is solved,If anybody interested to do so they can just use a RCA splitter to do so that they need not cut the speaker wires,secondly please do add a1mfd 100volt non polar condenser with the tw...

"I would like the revolution On The Subwoofer Design.... The 6.5"" Subwoofer given the heavy deep bass.... 2.1 & 5.1 mode was really useful... In 5.1 mode given the most clarity on vocal.

And writes this review after using this more than 1 month. Highly recommended by me. Thank you JVC also Flipkart.",5

"Initially I did not like the surround system. If the system is played with low or average volume, you will not feel the surround effect. Trust me folks, if you play the music or movie with high volume, its amazing, complete theatre effect. Its mindblowing and no words to explain.

"Great product 5 Star for product packaging and finishing 4 Star for sound quality bass is just good, clear sound I bought it for Rs 384/- Overall excellent product in this price...!!",5
Didn't expect such quality from these little speakers... Clear and apt... They sound amazing with my MacBook Pro lappy... Can be used with mobile phones... Only flaw was that the jack and usb cable are little shorter for my liking... But nevertheless very good purchase... I hope it lasts well.. Mini theatre,5

"according to the price of 420... its a good deal because of the smooth wooden built quality but dont expect a louder bass from this.. but the audio was very clear without any noise and the length of the cable is 2 feet which could be enough for most of the desktop users and according to the looks, its looking great.. so if u are looking for a budget good looking wooden speakers, then simply go for theses because no other company is providing in this price range and i will update my review aga...

Wow thnk Flipkart Mast dj sound very good nice dj perfect,5
The speakers are very good and even sound very well for a 4.4w speaker.... donot expect a huge bass or something like that...it is definitely recommend for general and low-fi music,4
"The speakers are of good quality, but not value for money. At this price 2.1 channel speakers < 20 watt from popular brands are available.  Bass response is there, but comparable to Sony XB10 speaker for e.g.  If space is really a constraint then only go for this or else go for a 2.1 channel in this price range.",3
very beautiful ful and sleek design... sound quality also good.. loved it so much.... quality as expected...,5
"bass overpowering the vocals.especially in movies,to hear correctly have to turn up the volume.at low volumes all i can hear is the woofer overpowering",3
Pros: High and mid sounds are good. Don't distort at high sound nice build. bass is okay considering the size  Cons: the wire is short for me u have to use 2Amp power adapter for best quality sound,5

Worth each penny spent . Prompt delivery by flipkart  Highly impressed with it's Bass .. it's classic  I have noticed product designed in such format that it's speaker at high low volume supports woofer sound ... which create magic sound .  I am very much satisfied :),5
Nice 5.1 speaker....5 small satellite speaker...one subwoofer Provides good sound woofer gives the proper bass effect  Remote works fine... overall a good speaker,5

Excellent sound effect 100% worth to buy it. Really I am enjoying with this product. Super,5
"I bought this product from Flipkart last week, after getting only came to know that it just have stereo input option. That means it is not an ideal one for watching movies... Play playing mp3 file it will be Good as sound quality is not that bad, but still volume on the lower side. After receiving I returned the product on the next day morning and got my cash credited back on the day itself.... That was Awesome... Thank you Flipkart :)  Rating for the device - 2/5 Rating for Flipkart - 5/5",3
Very good product for small room size like 12 *12. The best part is in this lower price flipkat is providing 5 *1 sound system. I have been using this from last 1 yrs or more but never face any issue. Good sound and special bass....,4

Sound quality is as expected from Sony. Average sound only. Connectivity is also poor. Only Bluetooth is useful. USB support is not available. You will not able to connect with old LED TV. Better to purchase 5.1,2

"Just one word it's SONY, Sound quality simply scintillating. Bass is punchy, you can get better sound via HDMI or Optical. Though there is no separate center channel for voice, but still Voice is crystal clear. One can keep listening to music non stop with this soundbar, make sure you choose correct audio mode as per the genre.",5
Value for money‚ù§Ô∏è,5
Everything is good Connection is awesome via Bluetooth. They've provided Optical Cable for TV Connection. You need to buy 4K HDMI ARC Cable then you will get good sound quality. Front Surrounding is too good  Cons: No USB option has given No Display has given,5

"This is a genuine review of this product.  sound: quality of sound is pretty good, but at full volume it's woofer produces some uneven sound. trebble and bass has a good mix. you will definately enjoy its sound. Bass is above average. It is needed to be placed at corners in room, like a home theatre to notice good bass effect.  battery: battery backup is awesome. it runs for more than 4 hours.  build quality: build quality is fabulous.

You can't hear dialogues clearly. Had good bass. If you put on full volume then you can hear dialogues clearly but at the same any background music plays you can't bear it on full volume. Need to adjust sound every time with remote or manually to meet your needs. Bass is good only for back ground music its good,2
"Nice product with attractive design, good sound and battery backup. Bass is also good but it can be better if we can adjust the bass and treble. Overall it is nice product. U can go ahead for this product in this range. 4 out of 5",4

Good and genuine product...Good Sound...,4
super sound quality excellent bass,5
The unit is fantastic. Sound quality is fine. Look is attractive. Bass is good. FM and BT work good. Only thing is that its sound output is some what far less than 30W . That's the only drawback. Otherwise performance is excellent.,4
Genuine review..as i used lots of speakers. High to low end ...but this is my worst experience..it has good bass bt worst sound quality..if u want to experience low cheap sound like street side Chinese speaker den go ahead....,1

"You won't get such a loud party speaker anywhere @ dis price which zoook is offering. D speaker is really loud, clear with great bass too. Most important have 6hrs of Play time which more then enough for any party lover. But, plz keep one thing in mind before buying though it's v.good quality speaker but it's not handy to carry as it's huge in size, weights around 15.5kg so you need a car to take it to PLC's. Must have speaker for party lover and Event organiser",4
The speaker is great. 200w is really great sound. I ran few deep bass tests too. The speaker is capable of picking even low frequency and deliver well.  This party speaker will really fullfill any party's sound needs. The wireless mic works great as well.  Speaker build quality is so good. Suits both in-door and outdoors.,5
Worth buy for me. Ideal for singing and easy to handle. Overall best buy.,5
Powerful speaker... Bass quality is so awesome... Best sound to carry anywhere.. One speaker can create party atmosphere anywhere.. Loved it,5
This product is superb and serves my purpose to hold open air meetings. Super performance. But a bit too heavy.,5
Thanks Flipkart,5
This product is perfect for indoor and outdoor parties. The wireless mike works brilliantly. Overall it is a great product.,5

The thing is what i expect is not given..This thing is ok and u can't expect more in this price..plastic build of speaker is very bad..by looks it is good but after doing contact with it u will not satisfy..the souon quality of speaker is not good and too high and subwoofer doesn't boom that type of bass..So u can understand what i want to say..u can better go for tecnia 506.. hit a like if u understand what i conveyed.,2
"the sound is too low and doesn't give a 5.1 quality. most suffered thing is that the satellite speakers wires are too short to put them in ur room for surround sound. better to buy a 2.1 branded speaker than this type of 5.1. the only thing that good with this is that it comes with Bluetooth connectivity, which is also performs good",2
very good speaker and good bass the volume is very good and lound at this price point it's a very good product,4
very very nice boffer in comparing the price I loved it so much and the bass is to nice I have been a great fan of it,5

Firstly Kudos to Flipkart the product was delivered less than 24 hrs well done.  Now the speaker. I bough the Rave Mini 80w. Came across this accidentally and liked the features. Before ordering I did some research as I was confused b/n this and JBL Charge. Well ultimately went for Soundcore as it looks were better than JBL and comes with a handle.  The speaker output is great specially if you connect it to your laptop/PC or TV. It really roars and fills up the room. A true beast.  At the p... READ MORE,5
"This speaker is mind blowing. Rave 160 watts will seriously amaze you. I was looking for a powerful bass Bluetooth speaker with good battery and good sound. Bass was my utmost priority. And I finally got this. It's bass is very heavy, punchy and hits you hard. Trebles are also nice. Battery backup is amazing. I recharged it 4 days back and it still shows 50% remaining after playing it daily for about 3 hrs. It has an echo controller as well, if you want to add a mic or guitar etc. I compared ...

"Damm..sound quality is amazing. The sound of speaker is really balanced. Battery backup is amazing, it lasts for about 3-4 days at medium usage. LED at front makes it more attractive. Build quality is good, and feels like it's a premium product. If you want a speaker that has a good sound and is portable at the same time then go for it, you won't regret.",5
"Sound quality is just ok, it is because although it has Extremely powerful bass (one of the best in class) but it does not have a good treble, making the overall sound experience dull and muffled. It seems as if the two tweeters provided in the speaker are dummy ones. Bass, built quality, battery backup everything is no doubt excellent, but sound clarity is missing. There must have been bass and treble control buttons on the speaker, which are missing. Plus the software also has limited opt... READ MORE",4

Really mind blowing buy ever .... giving stunning output while connected with my Projector upstairs better than 300W sound war.. At this price range no other speakers can run Behind this .. worth it >>>,5
Nice product got 160w for just 11000 its a steal deal. Little big for portable and heavy can't lift it with one hand. Bass is awesome loud and punchy. Go for it without any doubt. JBL is good but it will cost you double of this speaker.,5
It's a waste of Black money.,1
Superb and Awesome Sound üëçVery good design with built quality. Battery Backup üëå This is the real party speaker. My first experience of Flipkart is very good. The delivery boy was also very good. I bought the soundcore speaker for the first time and am completely satisfied with the product. .,5
Excellent speaker in this price range. Sound quality is superb but bass could be better. Light effects are awesome works with app control. Battery life is too good charging is fast takes 4 hours to charge. It has no 3.5 input you have to use audio pin. Overall a good package. You can check my review on YouTube,5

sound is good but he was saying 60watt on Flipkart. it is clearly mention on the Box it is up 30watts only. he was saying a lie. some words... but delivery is good on time. my opinion it is better to take on the shop.on every electronic items.. because you can see your eyes and touch your hands on taking items..my words are very very very very important thanking you.,3

Extremely slow delivery speed. It took one week for flipkart to deliver the speaker. Later realised that the delivery guy took a long walk from Mumbai to Delhi. Coming to speaker. I bought it to pair with my extreme. The outcome is just mind blowing. Together they put to shame a decent home theatre. I get the convenience of wire free setup and extremely handy speakers. Try playing EDM and you get a trance porting music trip,5
"This is first time I m writing a review in Flipkart. JBL flip 3 is an important factor of every party now. such an amazing Bluetooth speaker.thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery and for the Diwali discount. got this @Rs 4097 during Diwali offer.. so happy to have this..  if you are planning to any speaker,you can trust this one blindly,it is worth of every penny..",5

I Really Loved The Speaker Doesn't Expect That Type Of Sound Quality I Am Happy With The Speaker But All Time Bluetooth Speaker Unpair Automatically And So Slow To Pair It Again So If You Buy For Bluetooth Speaker I Don't This Much Useful Otherwise Good Product .,4
Soun quality is very good also bass. Product is mind-blowing acording the price. Led are also good. Only the blutooth connection is lool it's did not connect and connect after some time. Blutooth is slow. But as home theatre it's good.,4
This is not 80 watts it's totally outputs 73 watts only. And sound crack High volume,3

"This is a genuine review of this product.  sound: quality of sound is pretty good, but at full volume it's woofer produces some uneven sound. trebble and bass has a good mix. you will definately enjoy its sound. Bass is above average. It is needed to be placed at corners in room, like a home theatre to notice good bass effect.  battery: battery backup is awesome. it runs for more than 4 hours.  build quality: build quality is fabulous. It looks very sexy product. material used is of good qual... READ MORE",4
You can't hear dialogues clearly. Had good bass. If you put on full volume then you can hear dialogues clearly but at the same any background music plays you can't bear it on full volume. Need to adjust sound every time with remote or manually to meet your needs. Bass is good only for back ground music its good,2
"Nice product with attractive design, good sound and battery backup. Bass is also good but it can be better if we can adjust the bass and treble. Overall it is nice product. U can go ahead for this product in this range. 4 out of 5",4

Good and genuine product...Good Sound...,4
super sound quality excellent bass,5
The unit is fantastic. Sound quality is fine. Look is attractive. Bass is good. FM and BT work good. Only thing is that its sound output is some what far less than 30W . That's the only drawback. Otherwise performance is excellent.,4
Genuine review..as i used lots of speakers. High to low end ...but this is my worst experience..it has good bass bt worst sound quality..if u want to experience low cheap sound like street side Chinese speaker den go ahead....,1
Super qalty,5

"You won't get such a loud party speaker anywhere @ dis price which zoook is offering. D speaker is really loud, clear with great bass too. Most important have 6hrs of Play time which more then enough for any party lover. But, plz keep one thing in mind before buying though it's v.good quality speaker but it's not handy to carry as it's huge in size, weights around 15.5kg so you need a car to take it to PLC's. Must have speaker for party lover and Event organiser",4
The speaker is great. 200w is really great sound. I ran few deep bass tests too. The speaker is capable of picking even low frequency and deliver well.  This party speaker will really fullfill any party's sound needs. The wireless mic works great as well.  Speaker build quality is so good. Suits both in-door and outdoors.,5
Worth buy for me. Ideal for singing and easy to handle. Overall best buy.,5
Powerful speaker... Bass quality is so awesome... Best sound to carry anywhere.. One speaker can create party atmosphere anywhere.. Loved it,5
This product is superb and serves my purpose to hold open air meetings. Super performance. But a bit too heavy.,5
Thanks Flipkart,5

Bombastic. Its a masterpiece in all aspects. You will not feel any requirement of dj after using this,5

The thing is what i expect is not given..This thing is ok and u can't expect more in this price..plastic build of speaker is very bad..by looks it is good but after doing contact with it u will not satisfy..the souon quality of speaker is not good and too high and subwoofer doesn't boom that type of bass..So u can understand what i want to say..u can better go for tecnia 506.. hit a like if u understand what i conveyed.,2
"the sound is too low and doesn't give a 5.1 quality. most suffered thing is that the satellite speakers wires are too short to put them in ur room for surround sound. better to buy a 2.1 branded speaker than this type of 5.1. the only thing that good with this is that it comes with Bluetooth connectivity, which is also performs good",2
very good speaker and good bass the volume is very good and lound at this price point it's a very good product,4
very very nice boffer in comparing the price I loved it so much and the bass is to nice I have been a great fan of it,5

"I've creative 2.1 for pc and wanted 5.1 system for tv. I didn't need huge sound. So, chose this 50w system. The bass is awesome at this price. Unfortunately, the sound quality / clarity is just 'GOOD'. As it's just budget product, had to compromise with sound quality. I bought this just for filling the basic theatre effect during this pandemic times. If you are looking just for basic 5.1 system, you can buy this. The bass won't disappoint you.

"Well, I have been using Creative speakers for almost 20 years. I use some other brands as well. I purchased this speaker last week (online) because I needed a computer speaker with RMS output more than 50 Watt. When I compare SBS E2900 with other creative speakers' (10 year old, 25 Watt) output, I am really disappointed. Creative has lost it's glory. But I still selected this particular speaker over others (Philips, F&D, even Sony SPD 20, Infinity/JBL hard rock 210) because it's still the bes... READ MORE",4
I'm already customer of creative brand since long. very old sound company and makes very expected sound products. it can be compared with Sony branded home theaters as well and results almost same and creative shows down in price and high quality of sound. my neighbor came to ask me brand name n model number after listening to the bass and other quality of hardware.,5
"i own both F&D and Creative speakers in the similar range, but F&D is far better in terms of crisp sound, high volume rock n roll",4
"The product is good. Sound quality is decent with a feel of bass. Not facing any connectivity issues as of now. But I had to replace my first purchase as it stopped working after installation. Flipkart was very helpful and have assisted me well. If you're looking for a budget 2.1 BT speaker, it's a good option to look forward to.",5
"Its sound clearence is very nice, bass is okay iam not fully convinced with bass desighn is good its very good for sound clarity if we see any film we can hear all the sounds clearly",5
"A Bit expensive in 2.1 category but worth the price and performance is good loved the bass, been a user of Creative from past 10 years and loved the product",5

"Amazing features like BT, FM, USB at an affordable price. But sound quality is average. Especially Bass is not at all upto the mark. I enhanced it with my oneplus audio fx equalizer but the speakers and woofer started to crackle at medium volume.",2
Excellent 2.1 speaker in budget. Look is very decent and attractive. It is more than enough for a 12*15 Room. It has all the neccassary featured like FM and USB slot and SD card slot. Bluetooth connectivity is very fast and easy. Remote control is full of features.  Overall a excellent 2.1.Recommended to all.,5

"I wish to give 5* Everything is really superb. The sound the look the bass the effects all are fine. But, if there is a digital display to know in which mode the system is. The item which i received is cracked in the right side one. I regularly buy things on flipkart. Flipkart must check items before sending. I think Flipkart is not like other cheating online shops.",4

Built quality is very good. Sound via Bluetooth good and loud Sound via Aux is little low But in this price 3800 its very good and quality product.  For Loudness as per 80w 4 Star Bass Effect 4 Star Built quality 5 Star Connectivity 5 Star Ease of setup 5 Star Brand Trust 5 Star Sound via Aux for Tv output is Littlle low.  All our suggested and recommended for buying.,3
Good product in this price range.bass and sound clarity is good.it's better than sony d-40 . Sony also good product but no bass and treble control in that product.panasonic is better choice.,5
After a month long research with the price constraint and the expectations i had i settled for Panasonic 4.1 HT . I wanted the Bluetooth and remote functions but with a established brand name. Have used Panasonic TV multiple models for over a decade. The speakers are worth the money. The base kicks in pretty good. For a living room of 13x15 this would be a great buy. Make sure you place the speakers well and at the prescribed places. The sound quality and bass effect are worth the money.,4

"Absolutely great product from Panasonic Japanese brand . I was searched 2 weeks for find a budget best home theater last I found f@d and Panasonic , zerbonics ....

"Well for the price tag it's VFM. At par with Sony D40. Not much of a difference with less price tag. Great product by panasonic. Loving it !!  Note: if you have a small room you want to install the system in, go for this because of controls. Sony has got loud bass which will probably be more of an issue than experience for small rooms. Choose wisely !",5

Firstly Kudos to Flipkart the product was delivered less than 24 hrs well done.  Now the speaker. I bough the Rave Mini 80w. Came across this accidentally and liked the features. Before ordering I did some research as I was confused b/n this and JBL Charge. Well ultimately went for Soundcore as it looks were better than JBL and comes with a handle.

Build quality is good, and feels like it's a premium product. If you want a speaker that has a good sound and is portable at the same time then go for it, you won't regret.",5
"Sound quality is just ok, it is because although it has Extremely powerful bass (one of the best in class) but it does not have a good treble, making the overall sound experience dull and muffled. It seems as if the two tweeters provided in the speaker are dummy ones. Bass, built quality, battery backup everything is no doubt excellent, but sound clarity is missing. There must have been bass and treble control buttons on the speaker, which are missing. Plus the software also has limited opt... READ MORE",4

Really mind blowing buy ever .... giving stunning output while connected with my Projector upstairs better than 300W sound war.. At this price range no other speakers can run Behind this .. worth it >>>,5
Nice product got 160w for just 11000 its a steal deal. Little big for portable and heavy can't lift it with one hand. Bass is awesome loud and punchy. Go for it without any doubt. JBL is good but it will cost you double of this speaker.,5
It's a waste of Black money.,1
Superb and Awesome Sound üëçVery good design with built quality. Battery Backup üëå This is the real party speaker. My first experience of Flipkart is very good. The delivery boy was also very good. I bought the soundcore speaker for the first time and am completely satisfied with the product. .,5
Excellent speaker in this price range. Sound quality is superb but bass could be better. Light effects are awesome works with app control. Battery life is too good charging is fast takes 4 hours to charge. It has no 3.5 input you have to use audio pin. Overall a good package. You can check my review on YouTube,5
The design looks absolutely beautiful but it is made of plastic. Sound could have been better although its not bad. Battery backup is pretty decent.,4
"Awesome product , especially I like the bass quality of the speaker. This is really very loud speaker in this price range. Built quality is very good and the lighting looks very stylish in night. I was stunned when I pick it up because it is very light weight. Very few people bought this but I think it is better than any other products in this price range.",5

Got this after 5 days!! Motorola is a big brand and now it proved it again in music system segment. I really like the bass n sound quality of this system. At this price range u cannot get more than this. I‚Äôm really satisfied with the product & thank you Flipkart for delivering this beast.,4
As its a 2.1 channel and comes with 70W sound you can't expect much. Nevertheless the bass is thumping sufficient for medium sized room. Sound quality is good. Motorola branding sits perfect on SW. Connectivity wise this system is awesome. HDMI Arc is supported.,4

"Don't expect much from this one. Sound quality wise, It's an average one. There is a gimmick in showing a an actually small speaker like a big satellite tower. Only top 6 inch of tower covers the speaker part and rest is show piece. So actually, it's capacity is like a 2.1 PC speaker system. Not recommended for TV.",3

Have been using it for over a month now.  Excellent sound quality and output.  Easy to connect with different devices through Bluetooth.  Woofer is best.  Sound output is best in this price range when compared to other products.  Plus comes with inbuilt FM radio as well which other products in competition do not offer.  For people who need decent sound system along with easy connections along with good looks should go for this without any second thought.,5
"For a room, this is a nice, colorful beast. The amplifier is quite powerful and looks colorful with the circular LED setup. Separate Bass and Treble controls give a nice grip on sound quality. There are preset Equalizer settings too and a special cinema mode too. FM works nicely but the sound quality differs by channel. I love the flexibility where you can make it a soundbar or have tower speakers. The bass main unit is great. This unit works best with HDMI arc but I could not test it. Blueto... READ MORE",5

Average,3
The speakers are very good and even sound very well for a 4.4w speaker.... donot expect a huge bass or something like that...it is definitely recommend for general and low-fi music,4
"The speakers are of good quality, but not value for money. At this price 2.1 channel speakers < 20 watt from popular brands are available.  Bass response is there, but comparable to Sony XB10 speaker for e.g.  If space is really a constraint then only go for this or else go for a 2.1 channel in this price range.",3
very beautiful ful and sleek design... sound quality also good.. loved it so much.... quality as expected...,5
"bass overpowering the vocals.especially in movies,to hear correctly have to turn up the volume.at low volumes all i can hear is the woofer overpowering",3
Pros: High and mid sounds are good. Don't distort at high sound nice build. bass is okay considering the size  Cons: the wire is short for me u have to use 2Amp power adapter for best quality sound,5
"Hard to believe it‚Äôs 4.4 watts sound output,can‚Äôt even fill a small room.",2
Very Good Product..... But little expensive under this category,5

Its not giving proper 2.1 stereo sound as both the speakers are placed on same side... But i can definitely tell that u guyz will never get this type of well balanced sound and bass quality below 2000. Im playing it on full sounds for 6to 8 hours since last 5 days and its sounds doesn't cracked single time... Highly recommended... Btw its not made in Switzerland Its made in china..,4
"Purchased it for 1299/- during big savings days 20 - 24 jan 2021, nice product, battery back up is awesome, i think it's mono, not stereo as speakers are fitted one side ... Over all good product",4

Amazing.. speaker!! Has everything in it. This doesn‚Äôt have battery. This runs on AC power source!! I assumed it to be battery and portable but not quite easy as a travel or portable speaker!!! But this speaker is awesome. Has everything you need for a party! DJ control through the Sony app and more importantly gesture control totally nails.  I‚Äôm assuming the RMS is around 600.

Points to take down before buying this. 1. there is no hdmi input only output through dvd player. 2.you cant play movies through pen drive. only from dvd. 3.Sound has some burning period. so it will get better after some usage. direct settop box or aux will be as good as source. 4.preset equalizers are ok to go with. in mobile you have to download app and bass booster to set sound.5 radio connection is poor. sound will not dissappoint you after some time. its amazing to connect with mov...

Worth the price. Sound is loud. Base is good too. Build quality is top notch. Best in price segment. Sufficient for medium size room.,4
Nice,5
Awesome package at the price point. Superb sound. Bass is awesome. However make sure DTH or any other content that you pass through soundbar is HD and supporting Dolby Digital output. Aux output is just pathetic to say the least. Even works with TVs that don't have HDMI ARC and /or Optical/digital out. You can plug everything to sound bar and connect HDMI out from soundbar to TV HDMI in and everything works like breeze.,4
"A very nice bar for your TV . Liked the audio quality. I check Sony and JBL side by side end up buying this. Deep bass gives TV viewing a different experience. It connects well with devices. After sales service is also good....works with Alexa If you need a bar for a mid size hall and you like good bass please go ahead and buy. This is not super good for music, not like a complete music system but not that bad.",5

I'm using this by connecting only Bluetooth no wires between woofer and bar also. Easy to install. Nice product. Love JBL. This is my 3rd JBL Product.,5
"1st things 1st let me tell you about the build quality. Feels a lot premium compared to other brands. Sound clarity is awesome with floor shaking bass. I dont understand how a guy gave negative on such a beauty. If you are worries of vocals try keeping sorround on. Lastly, people go for it you dont get a better one than this. Best used with Dolby atmos enabled phones via bluetooth like I use S10plus.",5
"To purchase a soundbar we need to first have a basic understanding of a few things. Please bear with me for the long review but worth reading once and for all. Due to limitations of words , I am cutting it short.  1.) There is no perfect sound system for all homes as most of the houses don‚Äôt have proper acoustic designs.  2.) Soundbar can never replace a home theatre as all the left , right and centre channels are closely arranged in a single bar .  3.) The greater number of drivers or speake... READ MORE",5
"The product is amazing but little pricey. The bluetooth connectivity is excellent and the battery life of surround speakers is 6 hrs if u use it at 50% volume. Additionally surround speakers has iotion of charging via USB charger (5v, 1.5 Amp). Against all the claims with respect to battery life of 2hrs I found 6 hrs. Hope this review will help someone.

This system has extremely good bass. However dialogue while watching films are not that clear even at medium volume even though bass effects and surround effects like in action sequences are awesome. In my opinion it cant replace a true 5.1 system with 5 separate speaker system and bass. However overall from perspective of setting up the system and wireless connectivity its superb.

I know it's hard to decide when it comes to choose a product like this. I'd recommend this for a gathering of 10-12 persons and works best in closed region. Obviously the build quality is sturdy but the feel is definitely Chinese as this gives out instructions in translated English while changing modes and switching on or off. Bass is not that great but yeah a decent purchase if you are grabbing one for Rs.4100 or less.,4

perfect tailor made sound for a tv ! lts also good as a standalone speaker. very satisfying bass. there more than enough thump to it. can get really loud. no one likes to hear the bass of a woofer continuously . its irritating after a while. this speaker sound is very well managed. only issue is the speaker is covered with fabric which will get dusty and cant be cleaned. should have been made of metal grill. kudos to samsung!,5

Definitely a great product. I love the sound quality. Was really sceptical about the bass but my God it is awesome. I think this is really producing crisp and clear audio and definitely something I love. Dolby audio plays really well on this. I think i made the right decision. Love to play music on it and watch movies. Sound is just amazing for a small room. Surround sound feature is also included which is a cherry on top. Overall terrific purchase.,5

"Damm..sound quality is amazing. The sound of speaker is really balanced. Battery backup is amazing, it lasts for about 3-4 days at medium usage. LED at front makes it more attractive. Build quality is good, and feels like it's a premium product. If you want a speaker that has a good sound and is portable at the same time then go for it, you won't regret.",5
"Sound quality is just ok, it is because although it has Extremely powerful bass (one of the best in class) but it does not have a good treble, making the overall sound experience dull and muffled. It seems as if the two tweeters provided in the speaker are dummy ones. Bass, built quality, battery backup everything is no doubt excellent, but sound clarity is missing. There must have been bass and treble control buttons on the speaker, which are missing. Plus the software also has limited opt... READ MORE",4
"Too good to have as a loud portable speaker. The speaker is insanely loud and clear and delivers quality sound and on the top of everything it is portable, ipx4 rates and backup is yet to be reviewed but seems good until now. All of my parties and outdoor travels are so sorted now!",5
Really mind blowing buy ever .... giving stunning output while connected with my Projector upstairs better than 300W sound war.. At this price range no other speakers can run Behind this .. worth it >>>,5
Nice product got 160w for just 11000 its a steal deal. Little big for portable and heavy can't lift it with one hand. Bass is awesome loud and punchy. Go for it without any doubt. JBL is good but it will cost you double of this speaker.,5
It's a waste of Black money.,1
Superb and Awesome Sound üëçVery good design with built quality. Battery Backup üëå This is the real party speaker. My first experience of Flipkart is very good. The delivery boy was also very good. I bought the soundcore speaker for the first time and am completely satisfied with the product. .,5
Excellent speaker in this price range. Sound quality is superb but bass could be better. Light effects are awesome works with app control. Battery life is too good charging is fast takes 4 hours to charge. It has no 3.5 input you have to use audio pin. Overall a good package. You can check my review on YouTube,5

Amazing product. Worth the money imo. The only bad thing about this is that its not usb-c. But you'll get used to that pretty easily. It lasts throughout the day at like half volume which is pretty much what you need unless you're looking to party hard. Just wait for a sale and buy this. Best speaker I've ever used.,5

"Don't go by the misleading reviews. I wonder how can somebody give 5 stars to an average or below average product. Most people providing 5 star reviews are either sponsored or do not understand audio quality at all.

The product definitely has few pros but the price seriously undermines them. One can experience same quality in products which are much cheaper in the... READ MORE",2
Recieved the product in excellent packaging. Sound is more than enough for a big party hall. Everyone can buy without any doubt.the bigger advantage is it has inbuit battery which gives a backup at most 3 hours Overall a very good product . Thank u Flipkart,5

No music can be played for more than 10 seconds even after charge. Moreover charge reading is not seen.Red light is not blinking after proper charging more than five hours.Take it back and give me a functional one as I have no reason to spend my hardwork money for such non-functional item,1

Sharing some observations: - Really compact & value for money soundbar - 4 built-in speakers with Dolby DTS & very good 40 watt sound output - Built-in woofers have great bass - Played ""Avengers"" on the TV connected to Soundbar and both the background music & dialogues sounded fantastic - Remote is really slick and can control both my...

"trust me guys this will boost ur tv sound to a next level, I am using for a week and I am totally satisfied with it. if ur tv has a Bluetooth connection then it is good cos u can avoid unnecessary wires hanging down from ur tv. it has got HDMI arc port means u can connect with a HDMI cable too coming to the sound bar, it has got rich and deep sound with a good bass, good looking design and not that heavy to carry, even if u don't connect with ur subwoofer still u get a rich bass. coming to...

Very clear nice sound and work very well iam fully statisfied with this product....and very neat delivery by flip cart with low price compare to other online shopping ....thank u sooooo much ....god bless u all for best service to us.,5
sleek and portable soundbar. i have a basic rnequirent for the soundbar so serves the purpose. good connectivoty with bluetooth devices. few cablen in the box should be ncluded atleast the aux cable...‚Å∞,5
perfect tailor made sound for a tv ! lts also good as a standalone speaker. very satisfying bass. there more than enough thump to it. can get really loud. no one likes to hear the bass of a woofer continuously . its irritating after a while. this speaker sound is very well managed. only issue is the speaker is covered with fabric which will get dusty and cant be cleaned. should have been made of metal grill. kudos to samsung!,5
"Affordable for money... Sleek n unique design for home users.. Pos: cost, quality, sound waves.. Neg: Display is not good, always will connect Bluetooth pairing for any device ... auto option is not available.. Aux cable option is not available through tv connection if we connect TV we can use OPTICAL CABLE for hd quality sounds.. we cannot hear more BASS effects...if we can hear special BASS effects better u will go other brand..",5
good 4000 price l am happy thank you Flipkart Samsung thank you thank you thank you,5
A good sound bar with decent amount of bass to enjoy movies / shows on television.  It‚Äôs a value product for its price tag.  Don‚Äôt expect any theatrical experience!!,4
Definitely a great product. I love the sound quality. Was really sceptical about the bass but my God it is awesome. I think this is really producing crisp and clear audio and definitely something I love. Dolby audio plays really well on this. I think i made the right decision. Love to play music on it and watch movies. Sound is just amazing for a small room. Surround sound feature is also included which is a cherry on top. Overall terrific purchase.,5
Very good product i enjoyed a lot the Bluetooth is very usefull there is good sound but i think they could improve the bass...,5
Ok,4
Its not like in the picture... Even the remote is smaller in size.. And less buttons,3
It is so loud and the bass is too good that I'm vibing when my mother is arguing with me. Jk No. Seriously it's really a good product with great sound and a fair Or above average bass.,5
Very beautiful nice product. At first they sent me an old product but in replacement the new product is super awesome. Thanks Flipkart for your kind help.,5
It is pleasure to write to review for extra ordinary quran majeed which is beyond imagination. The cost of product is nothing compared to the product.,5

"It is best product,at this price range.Deep and high bass takes u another world.Its voice so clear at high volumes. Its alone enough for a room to have a good music,with high and comfortable bass and clear sound",5
Amazing product. Worth the money imo. The only bad thing about this is that its not usb-c. But you'll get used to that pretty easily. It lasts throughout the day at like half volume which is pretty much what you need unless you're looking to party hard. Just wait for a sale and buy this. Best speaker I've ever used.,5
It's good!!,5

Very good product.,5
"I have been using this product since 8 months now and I must say and I am very impressed with it. I wanted to try something except JBL / Boat etc and I wanted something with good stereo sound. The build is solid and the lighting is just awesome. I'd definitely recommend it. For this price range, this was a great purchase for me.",5

"This Product is really awesome for this price, Sound quality super awesome, build quality is far better than Rs. 10000/- Hometheaters. Looks Are perfect for every Room Size, The Only Cons is I can't connect it with my Redmi TV via Bluetooth But can connect by 3.5mm stereo Audio Male to 2 RCA male Cable, and this cable also provided you from Obage.",5

"Superb sound quality. Can use BT, AUX, SD CARD OR USB to play music. Also there is FM radio. I ball rocks!!!!!",5
Awesome package at the price point. Superb sound. Bass is awesome. However make sure DTH or any other content that you pass through soundbar is HD and supporting Dolby Digital output. Aux output is just pathetic to say the least. Even works with TVs that don't have HDMI ARC and /or Optical/digital out. You can plug everything to sound bar and connect HDMI out from soundbar to TV HDMI in and everything works like breeze.,4
"A very nice bar for your TV . Liked the audio quality. I check Sony and JBL side by side end up buying this. Deep bass gives TV viewing a different experience. It connects well with devices. After sales service is also good....works with Alexa If you need a bar for a mid size hall and you like good bass please go ahead and buy. This is not super good for music, not like a complete music system but not that bad.",5

"Superb product. Movies are like watching in a theatre. Bass is just shattering everything, normal living room can't increase bass over 20 at max, might break glass. Connects with sub just like that, superb connection awesome stuff. Love it.",5
I'm writing this review after 5 days usage Love this product. I can feel that I'm in theatre. Especially sorround sound system and sound mode selection is awesome. I'm using this by connecting only Bluetooth no wires between woofer and bar also. Easy to install. Nice product. Love JBL. This is my 3rd JBL Product.,5
"1st things 1st let me tell you about the build quality. Feels a lot premium compared to other brands. Sound clarity is awesome with floor shaking bass. I dont understand how a guy gave negative on such a beauty. If you are worries of vocals try keeping sorround on. Lastly, people go for it you dont get a better one than this. Best used with Dolby atmos enabled phones via bluetooth like I use S10plus.",5
"To purchase a soundbar we need to first have a basic understanding of a few things. Please bear with me for the long review but worth reading once and for all. Due to limitations of words , I am cutting it short.  1.) There is no perfect sound system for all homes as most of the houses don‚Äôt have proper acoustic designs.  2.) Soundbar can never replace a home theatre as all the left , right and centre channels are closely arranged in a single bar .  3.) The greater number of drivers or speake... READ MORE",5
"The product is amazing but little pricey. The bluetooth connectivity is excellent and the battery life of surround speakers is 6 hrs if u use it at 50% volume. Additionally surround speakers has iotion of charging via USB charger (5v, 1.5 Amp). Against all the claims with respect to battery life of 2hrs I found 6 hrs. Hope this review will help someone. Regards",5
This system has extremely good bass. However dialogue while watching films are not that clear even at medium volume even though bass effects and surround effects like in action sequences are awesome. In my opinion it cant replace a true 5.1 system with 5 separate speaker system and bass. However overall from perspective of setting up the system and wireless connectivity its superb. Remote doesn't feel very robust and is delayed to respond. Felt audio sync issues with TV. Trying to cope with i... READ MORE,3

It‚Äôs elegant, it‚Äôs beautiful and I can keep it proudly even in my drawing room 2)Great Sound. Bass is so nice and to hear it good, play it with PC or with TV 3) Beautiful satellites 4) on the top volume controls gives it a very convenient edge to work on 5) Last but most critical! European brand. Hate these Chinese brands getting everywhere and taking market shares",5

Flipkart delivered the product at my house door in a well packed condition. Delivery experience is very good. Overall appearance of the system is attractive. Sound quality is laudable.

Bought this last month and found the product is damaged.. asked for a replacement and it was replaced in a wk .... found the product is worth below 5k price Sound is not so great... if you dont need a heavy output just go for an AltecLancing or JBL 2.1 speakers at this price range of 7k  they are a better option than this product in terms of built quality or sound quality.,4

Thanks for a good price offered by Flip kart.",4
amazing sound,5
Flipkart delivered the product at my house door in a well packed condition. Delivery experience is very good. Overall appearance of the system is attractive. Sound quality is laudable. Two USB ports with recording facility is indeed good. FM radio reception is excellent.  The shortcoming of this system is its CD drive.

"It's good, as I bought this in 7999/- but paying more than 10000/- & above is not worth of money. However it's good but if you are looking best and big then honestly sony party speakers are best than LG. So LG please focus more on sound quantity.",3
"It's FM doesn't work well.It hardly catches one or two FM channels only.Even,LG's technician couldn't help it out.R&D/Technical team of LG should work on it for the proper & smooth working of FM by providing a small antenna with this unit instead of very long ugly wire(which doesn't work well for catching frequency of air channels).",3
"The bass is good. It supports karaoke and recording. The functions that 'LG OK45' can perform are good and they probably justify its price. The primary objective of this device is to play out music which it does but with less elan as compared to the conventional Hi-Fi systems. The music output is below average. I have placed an order for LG OK99 too. I hope that it would not disappoint me like this LG OK45. Delivery from Flipkart, as usual, is swift and efficient. Thanks, Flipkart.",3
Excellent product from LG. Superb sound. Crystal clear sound. Amazing Bass.,5
"I liked everything But there is no Battery back up as mentioned in description.  Pro:- Bluetooth Connectivity, Music Volume, Bass Balance, Remote controller & Lighting effects. All this is enough to bring life to party.  Cons :- TV connectivity is challenge, also cable not provided. If this had battery backup- this would have been the best under 15k system.",5

The sound bar is good. However i dont know why i got so many problems during installation. I had to do it myself. No installation guy came even after raising 4-5 concerns with the customer support. So at last i did it by myself. I have a bravia led tv but still the sound was not coming from bar. After consulting few videos on youtube i got it done. So that five star rating from me. Sound is pretty good. Bass is also ok Dolby atmos works perfectly with supported tv.,3
"Amazing sound bar. Inspite of being single unit, this produces incredible sound and bass. The surround sound/Atmos effect is obviously not gonna be at par with other high end soundbars with vertical speakers but this does a good job of virtually creating the effect. Love the simple design, without the extra subwoofer it creates enough bass to give close to theater experience. What probably you need to keep in mind is your room acoustics.

I don't know how the other speakers in the same price range sound like buy all my friends find this particular speaker worth a lot more than 5k. The first time I played music on these. I lost it. It was too good. You might have to work at the placement of the speaker a bit but after you're done. These speakers sound amazing. The bass is nice and deep and it's loud. Neighbors are not gonna like your speakers for sure.  These are amazing. If it falls in your budget. Just get it.,5

If you want a router for medium sized Flat/home/Club use then you can go for it.

Very light weight. The range is good enough. Only one thing that it does not support the thetre app by tp-link so you have manage it through a browser.

It looks better than the image show by flipkart.,4
"Using it from past 15 days, so far it's working good. Installation is super easy, Plug it and in 5 mins it's ready to use. It's best for small size rooms and area but range is bit lower when compared to other routers. Given the price overall performance is satisfactory.",4

"I Used this Router for 30 days, Really worth for buying, easy Configuration & compatible with All ISP. I could have given 5 star, since the Coverage is really low, so I have given 4 Star. If you have Wall, you will be getting only 2 or 3 signals. if you are happy with that, you can go for that. Except the range issue, this is the best N300 series router to start with.

I would like to see this feature also in this router.",5

Only Flipkart has this dual band latest router. Good coverage on 2.4 GHz. Faster speeds with 5ghz channel. Thank you Flipkart for the fast delivery just 2 days.,5

nice product ok range nice build in quality. simple to install modern software interface can use as router or extender directly. but lots of time speed automatically slow down in LAN connection and WiFi network disappearance. need to restart router frequently. don't buy it. even my old TP-LINK TL-WR841N working very good as compare to this model. very disappoints from ttp-link.,1
I'm happy with this product. It's really good product and I think I have purchased over a perfect product. Range of the signal is enough for me and it gives me superb signal whether I am in the room or I am in another floor.,5

Its super awesome. Looks better than other routers. Has dual antennas which helps in transmitting signals throughout your house. Awesome product and easy to setup. u wont feel the need of calling customer care to setup this router.,5

"The product was delivered to me in a very good condition fr that i thank flipkart.Now about the router, it is really very good u can go fr it.though the range of wifi is nt that gud as when i go to another room the strength decreases.except that no issues.",4
The model on the ad and the box differs on some elements like led indicators on the outgoing model we're 4 and here there is only one indicator....is this the version 2 or not I do not know but still the performance is at par with the previous tp link w841 n that I had .....hope this also works for 3 yrs ....tp link routers are the best,5
Router is working great and has good range but only CON I see is that it has only one LED light to show internet connectivity it does not have individual LEDs for LAN ports.,4
"Its overall a good package. Have been using it for a week now. My honest review.  Pros. 1. Good range. Can cover while house efficiently. 2. Easy set up using TP Link Tether app. 3. Looks great. Elegant finish. 4. Multiple modes - can be setup as a repeater as well.  Cons. 1. Good for upto 3 walls penetration. Signal starts getting weaker after 3 walls. 2. No ONU, only has RJ 45 slot. So if you're using a fibre optic cable network you'll need a seperate ONU adapter to connect it to this router.",5

Works even in the corners of the house ( store rooms )  Pros- 1. Great signal quality 2. Great build quality 3. Easy to use interface 4. Very mobile to use any corner of house   cons- 1. DInt recognise my existing tp-link router to set up with wps setup. 2. The ethernet cable get stuck inside the lan port to remove from it. need extra energy to pull it out .,4

"Great repeater at great price.  This is an amazingly easy product to setup and use. It literally took just 5 minutes to set it up using the wps lock and it was up and running. No hassles.

This router it seems is a basic gigabit router which can handle multiple devices at home and for home wifi. Speed has definitely increased as i wanted to be sure that my ISP was not bluffing about the advertised speed and my internet plan for which i am paying money.After I set this one up over the older router of the same company and was almost 7 years old (Tp Link 740 wrn 150) the speed has definitely increased almost about 3 times. While 5ghz speed is really good at a shorter distance near... READ MORE,4
Wonderful experience so far.This provides more than enough coverage for a small home or a normal flat / apartment as long as you place it properly in the middle of the house. File transfers in the home network maxes out around 400Mbps( in the 5gig band) so far in my tests. USB file sharing also works seamlessly as long as you are using a Windows laptop/PC. Since it comes with an option to wall mount it saves some space for you too.,5
"I am updating my last review to inform people that Tplink is communicating wrong information. The specification says it supports over 800mps over WiFi but the LAN support is only till 100mbps. How will your router support over 800 mbps if the lan can only support 100mpb? They are misguiding customers and that is not acceptable. Flipkart should look into this.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-////////////  Pretty good buy for the price. The dual band While the performance is good, you could face issues with the range r... READ MORE",1

"Excellent router. Using it for a week now. The coverage is excellent. I have a 4 bhk house. Covers the entire house except a little area in the farthest room. No drops in connection witnessed as of now. The 5g band gives the best speed but its coverage area is less than the 2.4g band. I have a 40mbps plan and using the 5g band, the speed test shows the exact speed. Overall would recommend this router as it is comparatively very cheap at 1899. Better go with this than the 2 antenna routers.",5
Works great. The ranges of both bands are good. 4 antennae helps with that. The UI of the router website is very clean for a quick setup. Guest network is also available. Low end phones might not capture the 5Mhz band. Check if your mobiles support 5Mhz. My Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 doesn't support but the Nokia 7 plus does! You have to be careful on that. Almost all the latest laptops support 5Mhz. Overall its a great device and worth your money. You can reach a maximum of 100 mbps speed. That... READ MORE,5
"The router is good, but the horrible part is the network works only in 2.4ghz if connected to 5Ghz after 10 mins the network goes very slow, like there is no material network gauge by it. Where in if connected to 2.4g back again it works. Firstly range is dam low for 5G and it doesn't work properly. Figuring this out after 14 days is observation",1
"Was skeptical to choose between c20 vs c50. Many websites n reviews voted c20. But if you go to tplink India site, n compare c20 vs c50, c5o is better because it has beamforming technology which c20 don't hv.  This is very important. When you want a better coverage n reach.

Super fast router. You just need to connect it with a stable broadband service according to the availability in your area. Mine is Alliance broadband FTTH and I'm using just the starter package with 60Mbps. But Look what I'm getting wired/wireless both! ü§ëü§ì,5
"The router is easy to setup, have basic parental control and good coverage on 2.4ghz band. Overall I am happy with the product however at this price range they should have added a.

You can't set the control for each device, it will be applied to all devices selected for parental controls. Moreover the web site either could be allowed or disallowed)",4

Good value for money product  Range-good  Speed - If your connection below 100 mbps so that it's good for you. But if you have more than 100 mbps connection so better you choose a dual band(5ghz) router,5

Very good connectivity and range a bit less tried sign strength is good but if you go far about 10m it wouldn't give good signals. And app connectivity is easy to manage new and guest accounts. Overall a satisfied purchase from flipkart. And it's not a dual band wifi it's operates on 2.4 GHz band.,5
Best Router in this segment...Go for it üëç Better than other brands like TP Link or D-Link. This router has various features and attractive sleek design with matte looks which wins your heart at first look. And 4 high gain antennas are outstanding...It covers my 3 BHK easily. Easy to use and beat thing is that you can easily access this from your phone... loaded with features.  In layman language...This router easily sync with your day-to-day life.  Thanks.,5
Not enough range for 2bhk infact my old wifi router of iball was able to give wifi network till end of my room which had 2 antenna. I bought this one thinking it will cover my entire flat but seems antenna are showpiece. Sad with product for network coverage,2

Everything works as expected but for a 3 antenna router it seems to have a lesser coverage area. Not sure though maybe because of its positioning. I am pretty Satisfied with its performance.  1 star less for the delivery. Really took a long time to deliver never expected this from flipkart.,4
"Works very well. Overall satisfied with the wifi area coverage which does well within 1000sq.ft.flat from one room to another even till the verandah and staircase. Have to find out more regarding coverage booster which is a separate mode. I have been using the base pack of Alliance broadband and getting over 7MBPS speed while using optical wire via the router and in wifi over 5.5MBPS of download speed, flanked by 3MBPS Upload speed through optical cable and 1.5MBPS upload speed via wifi.",5

"I have purchased this Router for my house. A 960sqft. 2 storied building. The router is placed in 1st floor and in the center position. Signal is available in the ground floor but very weak and almost no signals inside rooms in ground floor. Despite of having 3 antennas, it is not capable to deliver strong signals. I do not suggest any one to buy this. Don't be fool by its 3 antennas. It works like a normal single antenna N150 Router.",2

Nice Product worth buying I have several devices in my house that demands robust network but my old tplink WR741n router wasnt enough so i grabbed one of archer c1200 for 2600rupees on sale and now i am happy cause it has 1.0gbps link speed which makes routing easy and overall speed constant and the wireless connectivity is also great for 1bhk flats.

This range extender work fine to extend range but it will reduce your internet speed to half of what you get when you connect to original router.

Great Product... I have a TP-Link Router which is a good product but although I have no range issue in Ground Floor when it comes to First Floor my Signal is very weak and I am unable to Watch videos only browsing is possible.

For evey router placement is significant. Place this at a proper location in your house and it will work like a charm. Gives me around 25 Mbps on 2.4 Ghz and 45 Mbps on 5 Ghz band.

Talking about bands - 2.4Ghz - it has really good range(beam forming) also as it's wifi6 5Ghz - has wifi6 but a bit low range comparatively.  Does the MU-MIMO job pretty well, no as such heating issues. And the OFDMA does work fluently.",5
2.4 ghz Range is very good. There are plenty of configuration options to use including turning lights on/0ff. 5ghz bandwidth also covers most of my house(2700sft). It's wifi6 ready. Though you need to have cat6 or cat5e fiber so that speed drops don't happen frequently. Connection is stable most of the time. As I said it's not for 30-90mbps plans. You need atleast 100mbps plan to get most out of this router. For local broadbands don't set to dynamic IP. Instead use static cuz they use outdate... READ MORE,4
OMG! I haven't seen speeds like this before! I was struggling with a very old router (Netgear N300) and never realised that I needed to upgrade in 10 years (dumb). This is amazing stuff. Thank you Flipkart for the HDFC Bank offer. Gratitude!,5
"Amazing product, have been using it for 2 weeks now, no issues whatsoever. A very decent range and specs in this price bracket. Have been a Asus fan for last 6 7 years and was using RT-N66U. After 1 month of searching other options finally took risk with this considering it been a AX router in price bracket of 6k. I have atleast 14 15 devices connecting to router over wireless at every time along with a NAS. It handles all of them very smoothly. Can go for it without second thought.",5

"Recently purchased AX20 from Flipkart. Router seems to be performing well. The 5G range is average and it will not cross above 2 or 3 walls. Dont believe on the promised speeds. It can be only achieved with AX device and close proximity. Supports OneMesh and OpenVPN server. It doesnt heats up much and has stable WiFi connectivity. Setup can be done very easily. Overall a good product, but costlier.",4
I am happy with the purchase... Thank you flipkart for providing quality products. This is my second purchase of tplink product via flipkart.  The device is able to handle big network without any lag... wifi range is also good. + It's future ready with wifi 6. Speed on wifi is Awesome..,5

Speed - Good. You will get good speed near the router with 5Ghz. I have 100mbps connection. I get 50+ Mbps on 2.4 and 100mbps on 5. Not sure why 2.4 is not hitting 100. LAN I get 100.  Range - Poor. For a 6k costing router it is poor. Only good for single floor building (1200 sq ft) . Not good for duplex.  CPU - Goos and delivers multiple devices.

Reaches the corners of my house which were not easily accessible. And the performance of the LAN is really good compared to the precious one I was using. No ping variability and inconsistency. Amazing performance of the WiFi. Great buy.,5
"This is a good router considering the features. I was using a old Netgear router which is more than 3 years old. This router performs remarkably better. Dual band is a big advantage. Both 2.4 and 5 GHz are giving good distribution of signal. Of course, 2.4GHz is having better range and 5GHz is having better speed.

"Excellent product, but packaging from Flipkart was worst as they just gave the router box like we collect from any store without external package. The delivery people should not know the product price and type. Very bad see the image attached.",5
Super WiFi router. Happy with the product. Range is good. I have internet plan of 200 Mbps speed. Getting above 190MBPS all the time. Little disappointed with the Flipkart package though. But that okay.,5
"I bought this router reading reviews and ratings, however, I have very bad experience First it got damage whithin 2days. Automatically stops after every start. I got it replaced and the new replacement router worked for 5 days and same issue happened. No no support from Flipkart nor from Tplink  It is waste of 6k money.",2
"Product setup is super easy. But as it claims that it have wide range not true. I have airtel xtreme connection with 200mbps speed. Deco main gives only 70 to 90 mbps around speed if you are standing near device, after 15 ft distance it decrease to 30 to 40 mbps, so i placed 2nd deco at 16ft distance at same floor but still getting same speed. After 20ft dramatic fall in speed even cause problem in getting connected.",3
"My home is 1750 sqft with lot of walls. I had to buy set of 3 and it works perfectly. No call drops, no dead zones and no signal fluctuations",5
Was a breeze to setup. Coverage is as said too,5
Very easy to setup. Super coverage. Get upto 80mbps at the farthest node.,5
Awesome product. Wifi signal is very good across the home.,5
Great,5
This product is wonderful. I have a 4000 sq ft apartment so I bought this for full cover and I should say that I am not disappointed at all.,5
wonderful,5
This is totally worth it if you have a big house and you want the wifi signal to reach every nook and corner with the same speed.,5
"good range as an extender... just slight problem you will get while installation at first time, but they have an amazing customer support. Easy step to install this you need to first place and plug this extender very close to your WiFi device (very close means near about 1.5ft) and quickly install the tether app in your mobile. once you download the app then open and follow the instructions.",5

works fine with the 300mbps connection. sometimes it needs a re-start after a few days. and it's good to go. range it not too much but it's good for a small apartment or flat. not suitable for an office or whole floor.,4
"I'm using this from May 2020. It is working like a charm. I have 3 storeys building, it gives full coverage on 1st floor on which router is kept but on ground and top floor it gives 75% coverage which is best for me. I have connected two smart tvs and 7-10 smart phones. All works smoothly on Alliance fiber connection. I bought this at Rs.799 which is very much reasonable and best at this range. If you're planning for a router then go for it.",5

"When you search for Routers online, you have so many options available with so many different price tags. Also you are sceptical whether you should buy them online or not, fearing the workability. But I can tell you one thing with assurance that this product is excellent. Be it the simplicity in the looks, workability, long term usage and durability. And yeah! its working still fine after more than 1 year of usage.",5
2.5 GHz Router Best Feature is you can monitor and control speed for each device connected to WiFi. Easy Setup. Extremely Happy with performance of the product. Option to block sites is also available May be useful for parents.,5

Good product,4
Good performance,5
The extender is good to the extent you ane not caring about reliability and some technical know how . Easy to set up in first place using wps but then fails to provide ip address using dcph so static IP has to be set for extender and the devices connected through the extender. Also disconnects during video conferencing or when more than 3 device connect through it. Anyway good for this price range .,5
Good reception of signals.,5
Not bad but some how good,3

"Well, used this product before (bought from somewhere else), the piece worked for somewhere around 2 years, worked well, so ordered it again from flipkart. The only problem i faced that too after 2 years was buttons stopped working. Decent ADSL router for sharing household broadband via wifi. Ethernet works well too (it will, it is meant to :P).

great if you are looking for a great plug and play mesh router. stay away if you like to fiddle with settings a lot. took me 5 mins to set up and I have not touched it since,4
"Loved the product and the ease of setting it up Previously I had a dual channel WiFi with two extenders making it a chaos changing SSIDs. The seamless roaming this brings along with one simplified SSID makes it awesome and sweet for connecting multiple clients.  I could also immediately see a perceptible improvement in coverage and improvement in speed, even compared to the WiFi extenders I was using earlier.",5
The product is fabulous,5
Works very well. Seamless connection at home. The app is very functional and easy to use The only con that I could think of is that each router does not have an individual on off switch but guess that‚Äôs just nitpicking,5
"It took me half a decade to decide whether it's worth buying a mesh router and I would say, blindly go for it. No match of it with any sub 5k router and the amount of coverage I get with speed is just WOW.",5
Simply Amazing!! Super fast delivery by flipkart too. The Deco Mesh is a boon to all who have dead Internet zone at home. Connected in less than 5 mins and now gives blazing speed in every room. Highly recommended.,5

Signal Strength is better compared to mobile(Moto G4). Works better with Airtel SIM getting speed up to 12MBPS but it fluctuates(seems to be network issue). With Jio sim also it works but getting speed up to 4MBPS only,4

It can work almost all frequencies in India like band 40, 41, 1, 3 etc.",5

My normal Airtel router is working perfect than this extender... the worst part is I get a very low range from the WiFi extender which has been placed in between the floor whereas I am able to get a better range when directly connecting to router...

"It's a good product, the range is way better than it was earlier. It does get a little hot after a few hours of use but I guess that's given as it's directly plugged into the socket and it's not uncommon for devices like these to get warm after use, will only know it's durability after a few weeks of continuous use. Until then it's a good product zi would recommend to people who have big houses and can't afford to have different access points all around the house on their internet connection.",4

I have rated this because it doesn't work properly. I have a 2 bhk flat of around 1000sqft but this router is not able to cover the last room. I spent my money to get coverage in all the areas in the flat.  I also observed speed drop frequently. The speed drop which I am talking about is not on the provider end.  I would not recommend this product,2
"Nothing extraordinary though, but does the task. Previous router used to cover almost the same area with two antennas, so if you are thinking that by 4 antennas, you are going to get something better, ideally may be a couple of feet max, but still happy as being an Indian thought, that got hefty discount so purchased it....... ü§ì",4
Amazing router with a power packed performance. Gives good range with both 2.4 and 5 GHz. Hassle free set up and can be done through app too. 4 external and one in built antennas provide great speed and coverage throughout the house. Totally satisfied with this router.,5

Will definitely increase your speed. increased my speed 10times. it can also convert 2.4ghz to 5ghz and make your life easy. just buy it to see the magic. *New Update* Long term usefulness is not that great. After few months it got slower. Actually it has some issues so will not recommended if you are a nerd.,5

"Wasn't sure if I would get version 3 or version 2. Version 2 has a better range, version 3 provides a bit better stability. Happy with the version 2 received üôÉ",5
Writing review after using this router for 1 month. It is superb... Provides good speed. I have 20mbps plan and it is providing me 19.78mbps. Download speed also from this is around 2.3mbps which is max we can get. Range of wifi is also good with 5Ghz it is covering full house. Good router to buy for 2500.,5
"Exact product as described by TP-Link. Excellent features as well as quality and service. Speed, range, connectivity and everything workink like charm. Specially 5ghz speed and range is better enough comparing other budget routers. Worth buying.",5
Wonderful üí° buy,5
Well performance,4
not that good strength only work on the same floor not on the second or third floor,3
Average product,3
The range isn't great. Hardly covers 12-15 feet on 5g.,3
EXCELLENT AND MINDBLOWING PERFORMANCE AS THAT MY EXPECTATIONS,5
good,5
2.4 ghz range is too much good.. performance is best. little bit negative point is indication light is only one. 2.4ghz range is more better than tenda ac 10.,5
"Its quite good for gaming , streaming , browsing and seeing videos at 4k easily",5
Item received without any damage. Using as wifi extender and the speed is amazing with bsnl ftth. Better than expected.,5
"It's just been 2 days since I've started using the product. It works really well. I have kept it on the first floor bedroom and have perfect connection speed on the ground floor. So far, I am very impressed with this router.",5

"The delivery was before expected time. Thanks. The router is working fine as of now. Few issues: The antenna of my router is very loose. Doesn't stand straight and It keeps falling..it was defective. I tried my Vodafone Sim card but was not working on the router (Maybe simcard issue) will try another Sim and update review. Currently am using a jio simcard, which is working fine (connected 2phones, security camera and TV). The range is only 1-2 bars and the D/L speed is approximately 5-9mbps... READ MORE",4
mission will be working perfectly TP modem will be very super working is very very super I will be in such that will be very working very nice will be very fast,5
"Router is good, solve the problem and you can actually customize most the things... Even if daily data analysis is not available.  Both the antennas are too delicate to handle. Can't even stand steadily. Also you need high gain LPDA antenna for better connectivity in very low network coverage area which you can get around 1500rs with 10m wire....So tplink should reduce this router price to 2500rs.",4
Excellent product With jio sim not required manual settings just put sim and use working fine best products must recommend for remote areas working fine low covered area before this i used Jio router but when its battery down same time my security camera aslo not working so i was purchased above product now 24X7 365 day my security system in working condition except power supply cut so highly recommend this product .,5

It is a good option to choose this router if you have a poor internet connection on your area. I am getting 5 Mbps (downloading speed) and 3 mbps (upload speed) this ... READ MORE",5
Using with BSNL. Speed is good compare with mobile for sure. People are using this device in rural areas. I lives in a town. Internet facilities presents here. My priorities is to enable wifi 24x7 in a lower cost (because this device using sim card so that it should be cheaper in long run and you have choices to use the device with your own term and conditions). Priviously I experienced jio fi device. Which was only bounded with jio. In that senerio this is best device for me.,5
"Working very good with VI Sim 4g and giving the actuall speed. But You must clear that this is not to gain signals or boost internet speed its just to create a wifi zone using your cellular data or broadband Net. Please don't buy just for gaining speed or boosting signals.  I have checked internet speed while using sim on mobile as cellular net getting same speed when using in this router.  And yes No RJ 11 Port in this Router, so keep in mind there is no Telephone/Landline socket",5
very good product thanks flipkart I use it here today it is good but I hope to work in my coumtry Gulf with SIM card I hope that thanks Flipkart,5
"Overall the performance of the router is better than I expected. The signal strength is good even with 5ghz, tested by transferring files from network, wow the speeds are amazing 40gb files was transferred within 15mins. The signal strength is very good, the 5ghz is reaching to the ground floor with full signal and 2.4ghz is reaching over till 3 houses down the lane. Based on value for money it's the best.",4
"It provides good speed throughout multiple connected devices (MU MIMO)on optic fiber internet (100Mbps), not just good speed i played 4K UHD video on my Laptop and Smart TV at same time guess what it played complete without a single buffer on both device.

I have been using this router for more than 2 months but still I have not got any issue... I had bought this one for Rs. 1499 on flipkart offer price. One thing I must say that if you access this router from ground floor to the 1st floor it will definitely serve your purposes i.e. no network weakness in 1st floor but if u are planning to buy this router to accessible from ground floor to 2nd floor then it will disappoint you...... I have no issue... Very good wifi coverage up to 1st floor....... READ MORE,5

"EXCELLENT stability Speed on this router but rage is not high of any other tend router. You can handle this router of a tenad app very easily. 5g range is better than 2g. You can see some problem of 2.4g speed. Over all very good and its a big router. Thank you Flipkart. I have ordered 7th aug but it shipped 12th aug, üòü too many times spend for shipping and delivered in 3 daysüòÖ so shipping time aur vi kam karna chahiye Flipkart",5
"Very nice product, I recommend it to everyone who wants a dual band wifi router at least price..... The product is a 5 star rating product but I am giving 4 star because one of the four antenna is very loose and looks like a factory faulty product but I am happy with the router's potential so I didn't request for the replacement..... But overall product I very fantastic love it.",4
"Nothing out of ordinary, if you have used a 802.11 ac before you know what you would be getting into. Setup is minimal and be up and running in less than 5 minutes. LEDs are bight and can be turned off manually with scheduled timing. And supports beam forming. For those who keep their modem on workdesk this doesn't whine, Its pretty silent. Play around the settings you also get iptv support with proper stb.",5
Great product at good price with all useful features. Pros: Especially 5GHz band speed is awesome. Dual band wifi is useful Control your router with tenda mobile app On off timing + parental control Good range for 2BHK flat(1000sqft). Constant internet speed Value for money product  Cons- router material is not looking premium. It is light weight plastic .  Recommend for WFH and Gaming,5
"It works good with dual band, also range is too good. I'm able to connect my mobile in a range of 20 meters with good connectivity.",4
getting full speed for 2.4 GHz. range is little less for 5ghz but it is very good. overall it is working good and there are no disconnection problems like in tplink. one of the best routers to buy under 2k. I will recommend this.,5
It does not cover the range what i have expected..but it is good as in the build..and good work from the delivery team of flipkart..,3
Nice product. Received on time. It‚Äôs works like charm. The dual band provides good bandwidth range which is wide enough,5

i got this for Rs 1399 and it is far better than mi. it supports 5 ghz which is highlight it gives maximum speed. best for streaming and gaming. range is also goo good but not comparison to mi 3c.,4
Super product!better than other Routers!! No connection drops yet!!!!,5
Look if you really wanna know the truth just compare this with any of the D-link routers and you will be amazed. I thought netgear was best so i put off my D-link Dir 600 and this router on. I didn't expected that netgear would ne worse than D-link.,1
"please don't buy... it's not worth, after installing it's noticed that the signals are not even catching to a next room... waste of money and Router performance is terrible...  Not a recommended product..",1
"it's a dual band router. it creates 2 networks with different names, different range, different speeds. the band with 300mbps has more range band with 650mbps has less range, within the room only easy setup process features are Good, you can restrictions on guest access.",3
very good product. Delivering good speed. The only reason I haven't gave 5 star is because of it's less coverage area despite being a 2 antenna router.,4
Could Install the Item easily,5
Best single band 4G Router in Market  I bought this from Flipkart at a better price than others delivery was also fast. The device is quite portable n light weight. It's easy to install n works smoothly with Jio Airtel and Vodafone..

"Nothing Special. If you already have a specific 4G hotspot belonging to Jio, Airtel or idea, just stick with it. They work much better than this router for now. Firmware on this router needs to be improved a lot to fix compatibility and connectivity issues.

Product is good. Well packed. The internet speed is not that great as compared to the Jiofi I have been using. As the Jiofi provides me with 20-25mbps connection speed whereas the router gives around 10-15mbps compared side by side.  Range is better than Jiofi but requires APN configuration for internet connectivity which is a hassle.,4

Good in this price range.,4
Not up to the mark as a 4G sim router. Don't expect speed greater than or even equal to your phone... If you're planning to use this as a sim based router then i recommend go with some other option even jio/airtel datacards will provide you better speed...

Awesome,5
If you want to buy real gigabit router in low price go for it. Others on this price will tell gigabit but actually they are not. If LAN/ WAN speed is 100 Mbps then what is the use of 1200 router speed? Input is bound to 100 then at most you will get 100 Mbps from router. If you purchase higher band plan (more than 100 Mbps) from your service provider then also it will work because LAN and Wan speed is 1gbps for this router.,5
Horrible product,2
Last few days were stressful ..wifi lights were not coming on out of the box..flipkart said seller will decide replacement..I have up today and tied to fix it ..had to reset twice and now it seems to work. Hope it continues to work because then I'm at the mercy of tp link ..very bad seller experience,1
My first impressions was so good. Working as my expectations. Currently using as mesh wifi extender with my Archer A6. Now getting decent range without any speed drop.,5
"Worse extender ever, signal coverage is very low, and frequent speed drops on both band.",1
it is worth,5
Perfect for Archer C6.,4
V good,5
Getting good wifi strength. The device does it's job well. Quite expensive but really useful. As of now using only one band. Bought the dual band as it might come handy in future.,4
"This router is the best. Since work from home had started I was facing frequent disconnections on VPN. I upgraded to this router, now on 5Ghz channel i get constant 200 mbps speed. I have given one star less because the seller sent a used router but later got it replaced. But for the product its. 5 star. Works perfectly with ACT broadband",4

Best router that solves wifi range and obstruction issues in a 1500 sqft with fast connectivity.I am able to get 5ghz in all the rooms of my apartment with decent range which i never used to get with my previous 5 year old cisco router when connected at 5ghz so hats off to that ! . Its very good for gaming purpose as well with fast 5ghz network that offers best experience and low ping.so far no issues in connectivity and speed in the last 4 months.,5
It's been a month I purchased and start using it with dual band configuration. All of sudden it stopped working with 2.4GHz band and it works with only 5GHz and it doesn't even connect to this 5G band seemlessly for new device's..will have to try multiple times to connect new devices with 5G band wifi network. I did try all options by resetting the router as well but no luck. I'm looking for tp-link support now. I strongly recommend not to buy this product..,2
"Works good so far, although I expected better range from this reading all the reviews. But then again, my home has crazy amount of walls. So maybe it‚Äôs not the fault of the product. If you are buying this product, it‚Äôs good to have that in mind. Go for Mesh maybe in that scenario. Other than that, I really like the performance of the router. Looking forward to seeing how it behaves in the upcoming months. TP-Link is not exactly good when it comes to long term durability.",4
"The best router I ever had, it spreads the range well almost all the corners of the home with a lot of walls in between. Both 2.4 and 5GHz band supports any bandwidth need, the connection is real quick. This is my second purchase of our office.",5

Not a good product. 5ghz band works good for shorter range but 2.4 ghz band although covering good range doesn't give good speed.

This is a great device during travel for short term use, can be powered from a power bank and you can access your pen drives /hard drives from any phone/laptop. If you're looking for a router/range extender better go for a dedicated router, it will cost less and will be more durable. This device is a great all rounder.",4
"It's small but powerful and I use it connect usb 3G/4G and its plug and play , I tried connecting huawei 8372 and Jiofi JMR 541 and both works flawlessly and i think it will work with almost every usb dongle in the market!.",5
router is so good... speed excellent... wifi range good but not working out side room.... airtel dongle not support if dongle is locked... before use unlock dongle and use hilink webUI after work perfect...,4
"I assumed that being an electronic device, packaging could have been better. Additionally, I am having broadband with a speed of 300 Mbps and this repeater was giving an average speed of 100 Mbps only though placed next to the source router.",3
If you have router at home and / or your mobile has Hoptspot feature then this product is not required ( purely my view),3
Very bad not connecting,1

Works the way I wanted it for.,5

love the range and speed of the router.... if u want to need a best router in best price then go for it....,5
plz don't buy it ...router frequency break its single and u have to switch it on and off,1

"This router is awesome. Just needs to be enabled to 100% power, I m getting complete coverage in my 3 storey house with speed of 55 mbps via WiFi from a 60mbps alliance broadband connection",5
Good working for wifi router,4
"I m requesting for all customer please do not buy anything from Flipkart, at this time flipkart was a big theft,",1
very high covrage...got it in 1799/-,5
The above specifications given by this is not even met. The antenna quality is not up to the mark. It is not even covering fully in the ground floor itself. Please consider before buying...,1
Great Product. Speacially if you have lan connection across your house then this really works well. I have 5 Decos connected accross the house via LAN and the ethernet backhaul works really well to give consistent speed every where.  If you dont have LAN then mesh connection over wifi may not be as great.,5
"Works as expected. Bought it after much appreciation from my friends who have been using it for over an year now. Only caveat is the Max speeds that you can maxes out at 100mbps, no matter what your internet speed is. So, if you plan to use a internet connection over 100mbps, this is of no use. However, the connection under 100mbps is super stable and reliable. I get around 75-80mbps across the house at all times and even to stream a 4K video, this is more than enough speed.",5
"Pretty good routers. Getting these router connected is very simple truth it's app Deco, thank you TP-Link for such amazing product",5
Currently using with 100mbps connection. The connectivity is smooth and doesn't blip. Speed is almost consistent with very minimum speed drop.,5
"Installing the router was damn easy, you don‚Äôt even require a computer, its a 2 min process, speed is good and there are no network drop issues, I have not installed the second router yet, Will update the review after installing it.",5
Good product,5
"You can connect each deco both wireless and wired. You can connect unlimited deco. First deco must be connected to router or as a router itself. Then you can connect 8port, 16 port switch and connect many more deco for seamless connection...",5
"It works very well. Range could have been better. But, I think I would have the same complaint with any other mesh router",5
Super fast mesh solution,5

only thing i like abt this is my router is installed on first floor near window and i m in 4 th floor im getting the same speed as on 1 st flr but too expensive to buy,5

Just Awesome,5
Perfect product. Worked for me with hikvision cctv camera for 100 meters cat 6 cable with POE. No latency for such a long distance.,5
Useless,1
This is a gigabit PoE. Using it with Tenda W6-S Wall Access point. Working 24x7. Highly recommended,5
This does not work with Tenda O6 access point. And there is no replacement option available from Flipkart. Waste purchase.,1
The adapter is good. Capable of WiFi 6 standard. With 2 antennas it creates 2 MIMO channels on 5 GHz band. WPA 3 gives latest security (need to install new firmware for this.)  Worst Flipkart seller - sells opened products as a New one. The one I received was returned by someone else.  Worst packaging by Flipkart. No separate box. Sticks all their labels on the product box itself. After removing it removes the product description as well.,4
Working fine so far. Price is high for now I feel.,5
Good happy with it,5
"Really a terrific purchase. I'm able to see ssid of my neighbours which weren't detectable earlier. I could feel the difference in speed too on testing with speedtest. Moreover, it enabled me to share my screen over my smart tv",5

An amazing product. Range is pretty good. Speeds are AMAZING. I bought this router keeping in mind future proofing. App and system user interface is just as butter and easy to understand. I can monitor my usagw and set the priority devices. Device heats a little tooo much. Just would ask flipkart to improve packing. They gave me the box as it is without any covering.,5
"good product, works well.  Pros: Wifi 6, inbuilt antivirus protection. USB 3.0 port, phone app, guest network.  Cons: Does heat up a bit. If you are an advanced user this product is not recommended. It does not have basic things like bandwith control, and bandwith allocation for guest network.",2
Can say it's best affordable ax protocol compliant router. Excellent range across my home (its fitted centrally). Improved latency hence response has also improved. No issues/complaint till now. Simultaneously we can connect 2.4ghz or 5ghz complaint to WiFi devices. Great features to completely manage your bandwidth as per usage. If you want to be future proof then its clear choice. You can mount hard disk on it to have a local network drive. No heating as 1cm gap at bottom improves airflow(r... READ MORE,4
Writing this review after a week of usage : Pros: 1. Good wifi coverage in both 5ghz and 2.4 ghz bands. 2. More Reliable compared to my old netgear router. 3. Getting better battery backup on wifi 6 devices. 4. VFM compared to netgear and asus for similar specs.  Cons: 1. The admin portal and tether app both lack quite a few features compared to netgear and asus .  P.S.

"Runs good, just need a reboot everyday as all routes necessarily need. Speed is good however you can only take advantage if you have Wi-Fi 6 enabled devices. As for marketing, I'm not very impressed by VFM quotient for this router as it is not Intel based but Maxlinear 600 Series chipset which has been licensed to Intel. So no dual core processors by Intel.",4
Nice one,5
Very good router and does the job. Does heat up though. Still recommend it,5
Not Very Impressive With wifi 6 Device Actual Speed test upto 600Mbps on 5Ghz. But Very Disappointed by 2Ghz you will get around 50Mbps... way less expected. 2ghz performance is just like N300 Models of any Router.  My opinion waste of Money. Regretted after Buying. There are many other Cheap option with mostly same performance.,2

Sometime ago I used 2.4g routers the speeds were fluctuating alot cause there were a lot of 2.4g connections around me but as soon as I put this my speed weren't fluctuating my speeds were 200 mb/s flat best router at this price,5
The signal range of the product is very less. The product is non-returnable too. Customer,1
Good quality ‚ò∫Ô∏è,5
The 2.4 ghz range is low. The 5 ghz range is expected to be low but it works really nice but the 2 ghz range is hilariously very low. This router is not meant for a house bigger than 1200 sq. ft. of carpet area.,3
Very nice product,5
yes good . thanks flipcard,4
Waste product not connecting don't buy this,1
As I have changed two router before this but I was not satisfied with those. I happy to say that Mercusys Ac 10 1200 is very router in range and as well as in speed.,5
Perfectly fine working for past 3 months If u are a esports player plannibg to purchase this regarding ping issue Just go for it Been playing pubg and COD with The 5G network and getting over the pibg difference of 50-60ms Single band: 120ms or above Dual Band: 48- 70ms,5

So many options, e.g. you can switch off the LEDs at night, you can use a 4g dongle/phone as a secondary WAN, create a mesh, aiProtect, Cloud, Adaptive QOS and what not!  Hated: 1.

Great device. Good speeds. Although installation does not tell where to plug the cable provided with the product. I had to search YouTube videos to find out and plugged it to a free usb inbuilt port in the motherboard. It also has an extra bracket for mini itx board form factor.,5
"One of the best wifi kit for the desktop, consistent speed and connectivity.",5
Nice performance....,5
works out of box in linux.mx linux and manjaro.,5
This product is perfect. You just need to figure out right places in the house for the satellites after you install the main router. I used it in 2500sqft house and it is giving very good speed throughout the house.,5
Very expensive but no one can beat this product,5
This is an excellent product and must have for larger homes. I use it in the access point mode but a router mode will provide you with greater flexibility.,5
"Excellent coverage, easy to setup, ethernet backhual enables usage of full bandwidth.",5

Gives good 5hz speed upto 5-8 feet. Then this regular speed. I am using 250mb plan and i am getting arnd 200+ speed in 5ghz. Its a bit time to restart. 4 mins. But i recommended this for the price point,4

The installation is seamless and the app works fantastically giving all the connection information, data consumed etc etc as mentioned in the product description.  Recommend for purchase.",5
"Firstly it is not 1200 mbps its 867 mbps. Secondly, 867 mbps has no use because it supports LAN connection of 100 mbps only so if one will connect 2 devices on 250mbps connection.  I was getting 125mpbs without this device in parallel on 2 devices and with it its reduced to 30mbps.",1
Product works like a charm.I am using this for my 3 bedroom apartment.Now I have the same speed at each corner of the house.Setup is also really easy.Only mobile is required.,5
Doesn't working 3 decos on even 2 floors in 1500 sq feet area,1
"Excellent Purchase. I was bit hesitant after reading online that mesh network routers are not successful. Well, I thought of giving it a try as experiences may differ because of several reasons.  Ordered it during Big Billions Day and received within 48 hours. Set up was damn easy (15-20 min).  Best way is to connect one Deco to your router via a LAN cable and then connect remaining decos. Do not use Deco as a main router.  I now have 100% wifi connection across my home.  Go for it.",5
Amazing product at very competitive pricing. My entire house is now wifi connected. At dead zones I am getting connectivity of 56mbps. Was struggling for last one year for a cost effective solution and TP Link Ac1200 is the answer.,5

It‚Äôs not good as the network fluctuations and the distance is very less it can‚Äôt even transmits to another room. Very unsatisfied with this product please don‚Äôt buy this product at all It even disconnects know and then and will keep asking for password worst product ever,1
wonderful gadget... easy config.,5
Upgraded from an old 300mb extender and the difference is mind-blowing. Specially the 5Ghz WiFi gives full speed even at the ground floor. The router is at the First Floor and the extender is connected wirelessly in the living area of the ground floor and I get full speed in my both bedrooms and the drawing room on the groud floor. At last my 50 Mbps Fiber Internet connection is being used to its full potential.,5
every time it is asking for log in. Also range is not good as my previous router WNR612. Feels speed is getting down also.,3
It‚Äôs good. However the range is not as good as it claims. Nevertheless you get two of these if you are living in a 20 meter wide house üòÄ,4
Very good ranges with dual band. Hint - Keep the ssid and password for both the bands as same. Use ONLY ONE band to connect to the main ssid and leave the other band for client connections to enhance speed.,5

No streaming issues uptill now Very easy to setup Great support from Netgear If you have a big area to cover I suggest use a range extender along with this device. Make sure you update it to the latest firmware.,4
"Good router if you want to upgrade router for speed and nas support.  pros: Good speed over wifi and ethernet, 1000mbps Lan ports, dual band, NAS support, can connect to USB storage and printer.

"Very good Pricing. Excellent Features, just what i wanted with an easy to configure interface. Works great, I'm currently running on dual band with devices connected on both bands, pretty stable so far. Gigabit Ethernet , and Local USB storage as a network location also works flawlessly. Connected 2 pen drives and a SD card reader using a USB hub, and it mounts with good transfer speed. Range is decent. TL;DR Excellent router for the money .",5
"after using few months , it was not as expected as I need... during Dasara , i was in a situation to relocate my LED from one corner to the opposite corner . they time I found that the WiFi readable length was not good... it is just fair and sometime goes to normal. earlier the LED was close to the WiFi router .",3
"Best in class router with great features, True specs and mind blowing range. Bought it for my home based office and was very happy with it. Its price should have be around 8000. Its really Value for money. Great speed with power performance.",5
"Dear Madam/Sir, RE: Netgear Smart WiFi Router connects multiple devices using the 802.11 ac Dual Band Gigabit technology which reduces interference and offers better connections to more WiFi devices. Speeds upto 300+867 Mbps can be achieved and Ethernet wired Gigabit ideal for HD gaming and video. Easy push button (WPS) links most of the WiFi enabled devices such as printers and other smart electronic equipment. WiFi range is good.",4
"Got it for 2000 on Republic Day sale... Epic purchase, after a LOT OF RESEARCH... If you have 100mbps+ connection, it's the router with 10/100/1000 mbpsbwan port... Which means it's the router which can take 1gb upto speed as input, any other wan with only 10/100 mbps ports can't take much input than that!!! Best all purpose router, go with it.... Enough 5ghz range for a medium sized home across 2 walls",5
"everything is good except range...setup was easy, it took 5 mins only...but range is same like my old router Netgear N150...the main advantage is that now I can enjoy full speed 75 Mbps.",4

Not 1 minute of downtime since installed. Covers my 1200 sqft house right upto all corners without any drop in speed. The 2 units are installed in straight line of sight. If you have a wall between the 2 units then the speed might drop.....,5
"Earlier, l had to use multiple router-repeater to get signal to far corners. Multiple SIDs had one challenge of devices sticking to the furthest device. I still use multiple devices with one SID. Best part is that the router has no controls and entire device management is from a handy app.",5

"It's a very decent router. Has good features as 3 detachable antennas, USB 3.0, gigabit Ethernet port. Range is OK type for 1000 - 1200 sqft apartments. However, there are many low priced routers does far better job in terms of range. Don't just go by high gain antennas, their transmition power factors a lot when it comes to range and this router fails in that term.  Overall, it's a good router but does not justify the price you pay when it comes to range.",3

Also it's support Mesh connectivity option.",5
Very good purchase. I upgraded from AC1200 and straightaway I see a huge increase in coverage area especially with the 5ghz bandwidth. 2.4 ghz is still a bit patchy. Router setup is not more than 5 minutes and is very straightforward. Router size is a bit bigger than I imagined looking at the photos but is not a big problem. Overall a decent value for money.,5

"Good product but still not able to provide 100% network coverage within 20 feet from the router. Better than the previous one though.

One star less because not having the excellent coverage - that is what I had expected.",4

Keeps disconnecting from the main deco,1
Had to configure PPPoE connection as a router. But customer support not good. Problem not solved yet.,1
Dont but this product. I cant even and get a refund from flipkart. My 5 K has gone into bin. The speed performance drops from 200Mbs to 5 Mbs if you just move 10ft away from the deco5. My existing triband router performs better than this. the Sad part is that I cant use the deco even as a repeater. It has to be always connected via LAN.  DO NOT buy if you want performance. Moreover Flipkart is giving only replacement? What is the point.,1

I have bought m5 and E4 for my 1000 square feet flat (the wall is concrete). I bought initially m5 (main router and it is connected through cable) which was covering only one bedroom and hall.  The magic is started happening after adding the E4 (satellite mesh and it is connected wirelessly). I am using Airtel as internet provider and the speed is 200 Mbps. I am getting 150+Mbps in each and every corner of the home. You can go for it if you can afford the price.,4

Later I copied my old router mac address and put this in internet setup page and it worked. I am in fact getting a 10mbps boost in download speeds on mobile and 20mbps upload improvement on desktop. That's really insane how this router made a difference from my old iball router. I also connected 1TB HDD and it works flawlessly. The genie... READ MORE,5
Will recieved the product on time. I ordered TC link 1200 archer before ordering this. Though TC Link was much cheaper than this model I was not satisfied with the range. so I returned the TC Link and ordered the Tenda but later on I found that it doenot have usb port so I ordered neatger finally. I received the product and first impresion was good by seeing quality of adapter. I am getting good range after two brick walls.,5
It looks so good. It‚Äôs design and overall built quality is awesome but wait we are not here to buy this for its look We are here to buy for it‚Äôs work it‚Äôs range and it‚Äôs Dual band technology.

"It's been 2.5 years I'm using this router. Hardly I remember only once I had to reset the router because of my MacBook Pro, that was not getting connected some how.  Light weight, doesn't heat up at all, forget about maintenance, excellent WiFi networks (2.4 & 5.1), USB file sharing is also an awesome feature. The LED's are well functioned, makes it easy for you to understand whenever their is no internet connection. You can fall in love with this device.  I just loved it.",5
Superb product! It's been 10 days since I brought this and since then there are literally no internet connection drops. I never required to reboot the router as the internet never dropped since brought. The only drawback is that the router has 'fast ethernet ports' which means that it can support a maximum of 100Mbps speed. That's okay as very rare ISPs provide speed more than that. The dual band (2.4GHz + 5GHz) is an added advantage. The icing on the cake is the USB port for connecting pen d... READ MORE,4
Very Good Product With USB For Network Printer and Media server .I have A 75mbps connection But It gives Me Up to 84-92download And 76 upload..I Am happy With It.,5
very good router,5
After using this almost a year writing review:  Pros:  1. No issue found up till now. 2. Frequently firmware‚Äôs updates available. 3. You can connect usb pen drives or printer as well to access over WiFi. 4. Four different connections points can create as per requirement.  Cons:  1. No remote access. 2. Range is poor as compared to other brands as like Mi.  Apart from this everything is fine at this cost.,4
"Good one, go for it.  Range is very low , suitable for 1 BHK",5
*Best ac router with wall penetrating capability. *Iam getting 75% signal in 2.4Ghz N mode beyond three walls. *Also I obtained 90 mbps speed in 5 Ghz AC mode from my 100mbps fiber connection. * Router has lot of features for the price. *The user interface via both App & web is neat and easy.,5
"Great if u don't have many barriers, good beam forming, not recommended for multiple floors use.",4

"Using for a week now, significant increase in the coverage, when compared to the bsnl fiber Optilink modem, even on first floor I'm getting the 2.4 GHz band in full strength not the same with 5ghz, which was expected. Features like VPN, is working fine.",5
"The range is good. Able to get even 5GHz signal from a distance of 20 feet and can stream video from that distance. 2.4Ghz range is pretty good  My usage is like My work from home and online meetings on Zoom, Downloads, My childrens online classes, TV channels streaming Sometimes all run parallelly without any obstructions  I use BSNL FTTH with BSNL ONT device",4
Very bad better buy dlink or asus,1
Still not try yet because since the typhoon we still waiting for the fiber to be fix and working again.. But will update when I try it..,5
It's a Awesome Product,3
MIMO is great but range is not as expected.,3
Nice dual frequency router. Can handle multiple devices without glitches/break in signal. USB2.0 plug makes one hdd accessible to all devices connected to the router. Easy to setup a guest network using app or pc. 2.4GHz has a longer range (probably >50m) than 5 GHz. Best router at this price point.,5
Excellent performance of the router,5
"Mesh system network is a new and pretty dope technology. I wasn‚Äôt sure about the whole mesh system and if it‚Äôs even worth it or not or should I just go with a better router and an extender but I‚Äôm glad I took that risk and invested in the mesh system, it‚Äôs amazing. The installation is pretty quick and hassle free. All you need is a router or a modem with active internet connection and just connect these pretty nodes to one another, it‚Äôs that simple.",5
good product... and amazingly i got it only for 1500 here on flipkart... not sure how they sold it for this cheap.. but its fresh piece and going amazing,5
This product works great. I was sceptical at first if it will solve my purpose or not but it is working great since about 2 weeks now. Great coverage across the home. No compromise on speed. I get 50 mbps across my home now. Super easy setup! A highly recommended product. Forget wifi extenders that half your bandwidth and choke speed as well as get slow.,5
"Network range is good. Connects the printers through wifi seamlessly. No worries about Multiple Routers! Covers a house of 3500sq.ft (G+2) effectively. The App though is a disappointment, not much you can do with it!",5
It‚Äôs a decent device but light weight & not upto the mark speed drops in between,4
A very good mesh router . Just connect to your modem with the provided cable and set it up using the app and instructions given in the box. Plug and play . Rest of them connect automatically. Lots of other features in the app. No loss of speed in any of the mesh routers. Claims to Covers upto approx 3200 sq feet . Go for it .,5
Very good product,5
I moved to a bigger apartment so I bought this router for more range.  I don't know the technical aspects very well but I can say this: - The range is decent. - The speed becomes slower when you ho even a little farther away. From 10m away my speed goes from 100 to 60 Mbps. - Customer support is ok. - Price is decent.  Overall if you are going for a budget router this one is good. But I would have settled for better.,3
I have been using this product since April 2015 and didn't face any problem till date. This might seem to be a bit costly than the average Wi-Fi routers but this one is value for money. No problem with heat and temperature.,5
This is review about product. The lights are too close and confusing. You have to gaze for seconds to see which light is for what. All 2 other antenna are useless. There is no multicasting. The is just piece of crap.,1

Its wifi signal is so power full.. and its signal length is excellent.. do not drop out its signal..  When we downloads any file or cinema in through mobile we gate 5 to 6mbps speed... And its work in desktop is great speed..  A special facility is Wirless on/off switch",5

Bought this router after doing lot of research. Performance is very good. Range is similar to other routers in this price range. Been using it for more than 2 weeks and not found any problems or connection loss. Very happy with the purchase. I get very good speeds (70-30 mbps) even on 2.4Ghz bandwidth and i get full 150mbps speed on 5Ghz bandwidth. Configuration is very easy and it is feature rich.,5
"Way too overpriced. On paper it makes tall claims but in reality it is just an average router. The range in 5GHz is very less, much lesser than the stock router provided by Airtel Fiber in 5GHz. Also this cannot be used as a wireless range extender with another router. And this is also made in China, although it is a Singaporean company.  I also own Tenda AC6 (which is replaced by Tenda AC10 now). That has way better range in 5GHz. It can be used as a range extender also. And AC10 costs jus... READ MORE",3

Package was good thanks to seller and Flipkart. Router is ok getting stable internet connection however the coverage is average. The 2.4G band coverage is even lower than the 5G band. Considering the four 5Dbi antenna the coverage is similar to the old Belkin N150 basic wireless router having internal antenna. I think there are other better alternatives at half of the price.,3
2.4 GHz has Good range (approx 60+ ft through 2 walls).  Needs a firmware update for 5ghz range to get detected (zip file available on the web).  Mobile App serves the basic needs. You can turn off wifi for a particular connected device which is fun. Also you can disable any or both 2.4 GHz and 5Ghz wifi totally when not in use through the app.  DDOS protection. Can set separate passwords for different frequency wifi. Lot more pro settings available. I prefer not to alter.  Overall satis... READ MORE,5

"Ease to configure via mobile app or connect using LAN cable. I will recommend to use LAN cable as it gives more control. Supports both 2.4 and 5ghz at the same time. The network coverage, speed and reliability has increased since I installed this router. The build quality looks very good. multiple members in family work from home, earlier in spite of having 50 mbps connection we faced issues, so we changed the router. Good product.",5
"Writing my review after 3 days of usage. Hardware Version 1 was delivered to me, though there are not many differences between Version1 & 2: I got this confirmed from TPLink Support. The Performance has been good so far and the range is good. I've been using this in conjunction with an Archer C60, in WDS bridging mode for 5GHz.  I liked the NAS on USB feature a lot. You could connect the drive to the router and access files in both RW or R mode, and also configure user-based access restrictions.",4
Good purchase. App was not discovering Router.,4
"So far so good on the replacement, first device went faulty after 3 days of use, replacement is good so far, it's been a week now. Thanks to both Seller and Flipkart for giving the replacement quick.",5
"The router could be good for many people, but turned out to be nearly useless to me, as this doesn't have WDS bridging option.",1
Pathetic. Not stable at all. Has less range as compared to my old tplink router. Older tplink router which is 1/5th cost has better range and speed than this one. I purchased it with great expectations but utterly disappointed.,1
I have used this product for almost one year. It has worked well. There have been no issues. The wifi coverage is good and LAN performance is good.,5

A very good router with a lot of functions. The USB works flawlessly and you can setup either a Windows SMB share or a DLNA Server or both. Speeds are excellent. A feature called SmartConnect allows dual band configuration on the same SSID but with this the client devices take longer to auto connect to the wifi. It ia recommended thus to have two separate SSIDs for 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. Range is pretty good too. Other routers from the Exo series can be used to create a mesh network.,5

The product is good but not great . The paring of statellite and app expereience and is not great. Also advert. says it has USB 2.0 but it doesnt have this port. The speed is good but please read the speed details on the actual site. I am yet to try usage of Alexa.,3
To setup the product was not easy as I thought it should be. Have setup many network products in the past hence could do it fairly easy. This router and satellite works fantastic in my home. I have an apple airport extreme router as well. Had lot of deadspots in my home with that. With ORBI the signal strength is pretty good throughout the home. The handover of connection between the router and satellite is not very seamless. Disconnect the wifi and reconnect then it does connect to t... READ MORE,5
"good buy, setup was easy. Now I get good signal even in the farthest corner of my house. also switches from 5g to 2.4g band automatically depending on proximity from satellite or router.",5
"Great router. No signal drop, reaches to all dead ends.",5
"I bought this to cover a duplex home covering an area of ~3K sq feet. Even the furthest corners of my home, I get atleast 4 bars of WiFI signal, with a download speeds of upwards of 100 Mbps.  Closer to the router, speeds go upwards of 250 Mpbs, and all my worry of wifi reach is solved. Setup was fairly straight forward using the Orbi mobile App.  I am satisfied with the product and the performance I am getting from this.",5
"Must needed Router n Satellite, simple to configure nd good use fr more than 1 or 2 story building",5

Quality Product,5
"Very much satisfied with the product. I have been using it with Vodafone 4G sim, getting download speed about 30 to 35 Mbps which is more than enough for me. Only thing to remember that this is ver 2.0 , and antennas looks different than shown in photo. But, that's not much concern to me. Go for it if you have good 4g coverage in your area",5

I agree with the review comments by Vishal Bedi. It doesn't serve what it promised as per the Dlink website.. The signal strength decreased to 2 point in the adjacent room itself. So single unit covering 2000 sqft stands impossible. Signal stability is good. WiFi roaming is upto the mark. I needed 2 covr unit to cover my 2 bhk house which was not my expectation. Signal coverage is below average.,3
"Early review, so might update it later. The initial impression is average. It is a good product, easy to set up, comes with a decent mobile app. D-Link website advertises that a single point can easily cover 2000sq.ft. home and this is where the disappointment starts. It is not able to cover an adjacent room 2000 sq.ft. is way off the charts. Apart from that, it's a good product, with false promises. A decent upgrade to a regular dual-band router.

Coverage not good. Speed also not good even rated speed is 1200mbps. Earlier used Mi3C router which is better one. Feature wise also I feel Mi is good.

Recently i onseeved that for every 3minuts wifi signal not coming for a few sec.All my devices are searching for wifi at that time.,1

Gets warm easily 4. No Syslog function.,5
Reading lot of rave reviews I purchased this device. Maybe it has high ethernet speeds. But the purpose for which the device is built that is WiFi is not fulfilled. It doesn't even cover my drawing room from my bedroom which is about 15-20 feet away. Useless device. Doesn't even reach from my bedroom to my drawing room properly. Huge waste of money. One has to be literally in front of the device to operate. My cheap single antenna router gives much better coverage at 10% its price.,1
Caution. Not compatible with all printer models. Please check before buying or try an alternative product. Not recommended.,1

This is one of the most advanced router. It turns triband when new many devices connect amd has inbuilt antivirus and firewall. Though the range is NOT exactly what I imaged. But it does really great. Now my entire house has wifi.,5
Router is fully loaded with advanced technologies. Its is a power packed performer for heavy users. Only issue is the range. After two walls the range drastically suffers. Overall satisfied with the performance.,5
It is good but not great. When the power goes off and comes back it takes lot of time to expose the WiFi signal,3
Though it says it's a triband router...But only 2.4Ghz band works and only one 5Ghz band works that also sometimes,2
The range is definitely lower than expected...got carried away looking at the antennas lol,4

With Airtel, I'm getting 8mbps speed on average when range is 3. RJ11 Port for landline phone also works. great. I'm using my cordless along with it. Caller ID too supported.",5
Best router ever,5
Not working with Vi SIM.... Network get cut off automatically... Not worth the money... Reviewing after using it for 3 months... Frustrated with this buyüò†,2
I have been using Belkin routers for a long time now . i had a Belkin wireless g Router earlier then i finally decided to upgrade cause i needed more wireless range in short more signal strength . and this one does exactly what i want. As usual Belkin has the Most Easiest setup u can ever imagine and it gives stream less connections to approx 6 Wireless devices at my house and excellent signal strength to a 2400 Sft House. exactly what i needed . I will surely recommend this product to every ... READ MORE,5
"UPDATE (15/06/2013)  I somehow manged to contact Belkin support India via email. They sent me a Image File and asked me to manually update the Router Software with it. The router's been working fine since then. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I purchased this back in Dec 2011, product has stopped working since Feb 2013. Dunno if it reached its peak or something, Pretty stupid warranty of 3 yrs, d... READ MORE",4
I ordered this product and received it within two days of my order. Neatly packed by flipkart in bubble wrap. This is an easy to use router for people having a 3 BHK flat as the range is decent enough to cover the house. I am using a 4 mbps connection with this router in 4 devices and the speed is commendable. the only disadvantage in this product is that is cannot be fixed to the wall so i need to keep it on a table. otherwise its a good product from belkin within the given price range.,4
"ok now i know same thing must be there in other reviews that how smooth it is and how good range it has....... but let me tell you how i use it....  ADVANTAGES>> 1. No cut backs in internet speed.... as many people say that routers reduce speed but as tested from speed test, this router gives the same stability and bandwidth and the wired broadband. 2. I keep if in the center hall which connects 4 rooms and 12 of us connect to it and play lan games like cs 1.6 , dota , most wanted.........12 ... READ MORE",4
"I bought this router about 4 months ago and its given me a lot of problems. I used to have a Netgear before that for 8 years and never ever had a days problem. With this router, i can almost never connect to the internet. I use Airtel and a BEETEL model which came with the connection. When i connect directly to the modem i get perfect internet. When i connect the router, though i get a great wireless signal, there is no connection to the net. Its terrible.",1
"Bought a Belkin N300 last year to replace my Netgear N150 to improve the wireless range at home. Facing problems with the router of late,the internet gets disconnected often, so the router has to be restarted every time that happens. The desktop which is connected directly from the modem has a constant network, but the router is inconsistent Its frustrating when you're doing an online transaction or downloading something. Used the Netgear for 5 years and never had a problem.",3
I ordered this product on 1st Aug 12:30 pm and got the same on 3rd Aug 4 PM. Thanks to Flipkart for such a fast service. Initially i faced issue in configuring this router but when i contacted Belkin support center issue got resolved immediately. Belkin support is Excellent.Coverage issue is still there.Signal strength goes down when move from one room to another in 2 BHK. But no connectivity issue.,4
Though Flipkart's delivery was awesome the product is bad because its hard to install and still lying on my desk unused.,1
guys this thing just sucks i bought it in January 2013 it had issues after a week so gt it replaced and it took 8 days after that it was working fine for 4 months now again it has issues i cant use internet on wifi so again will have to get it replaced i bought it for its brand name but it surely has failed to leave to the expectation so think twice before you buy it i would suggest linksys or dlink,2
Using this product for last 1 year. Just configure and forget it. Nice range. Easy to configure. Light weight and looks pretty. Good light to indicate ISP connectivity. Never faced problem once its configured.,5
"Linksys E1200 is a great choice for people who plan to buy a Wireless Router For Home Use and do not need advanced features like NAS server or Dual Band the router is easy to setup and configure via both Router GUI and included CD ,offering solid performance at Rs.3076.  Using it with my beam tele 10 MBps plan and it works like wonders :)  Use it for Xbox live gaming and there is no lag. Awesome stuff.

"Bought this router a week ago and WOW, I was browsing the net within 5-10 minutes of setting it up!  Good for a user who connects 1-2 laptop and 2-3 smartphones for 3-4 hrs everyday!  Watch out Guys!!  please note that you should have multi-standard socket or extra power adapter which fits to this router already else you won't be able to use the router until you get one!  The specification doesn't mention, that power adapter in the box is not compatible with de-facto standard 3 pin socket(rou... READ MORE",3
"I Bought this product today and was amazed with its looks and exceptional speed and consistency.  People who think e900 and e1200 both are also most here are the differences.  1.I Have seen e900 on box price it shows 2,999 and this one on box it shows 5,999. 2.e1200 has 8 MB Flash where as e900 has only 4MB flash having more flash will improve your VPN connection timeout. 3.e1200 has 2 antenass each 2.4 GHZ where e900 has 2 antenass each 1.2 GHZ which can give you more converage. 4.Advanced p...

"Purchase its elder sibling E4200 for 10k, which conks off in 1 year and 2 months. No repair or replacement provided by Linksys as out of the 1 year warranty period. The competing products from Asus, Belkin and Buffalo provide 3 years warranty. I have even had a better experience with my old Dlink Di-524 wireless router.  Though when using it, did perform well and gave good range and could hook up Samsung HD TV, HP wireless printer with a couple of laptops.",2
"I had a Intex wi-fi router at home, but range was not sufficient enough to reach my Hall.. So I decided to go with a better make router. I was looking for a single band 2.4Ghz router and came across this one. And everyone on this router here have given such a positive response .. So sad, to say..after buying this product I am feeling Cisco payed them for good comments. :-/  This router performed worst than the Intex in Range. It costed me Double of Intex router, both where same config. 2.4 Gh... READ MORE",1
"Although I'm a geek, I always had issues with selecting and then benchmarking routers. I bought this one purely based on reviews across the Web.  I can't comment on networking aspect; like I said, I'm no expert. The wifi (via Airtel DSL) works fine across my home (a 3+1 BHK apartment). I would've liked better strength though. I've never seen five bars of strength. I only use it on multiple laptops and smartphones; don't have smart TVs or consoles.  The device is very neat, and looks nice si... READ MORE",4

This product dosent even cover my 1000sq ft 2Bhk Flat  Pros :- The Build quality and looks are good Setting up is Easy  Only buy this product if you have to cover a single open room...",1
Cisco linkys brands is know for its networking solutions and devices and this device does its job pretty good. first of all setup is pretty easy only takes about 5 minutes. range is above average in my house{150sq yards 2 floors} some times i face connectivity issue maybe due to my mtnl modem{happened only twice} looks are good but there are no leds on modem so thats odd. overall good device worth price,5
"This is an excellent router, easy to install, secure, good range; and the best part is that it looks like small baby pouch",5
Seamless set up. Works very well. Does not hang like my previous Belkin router. Good range and stability,5
