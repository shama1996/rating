Dell has been given different views by different people I talked. But I say its a good choice. Computer may trouble, no matter which company they are, but an overall view can be deduced. IBM, SONY are too expensive, HP &amp; compaq are not reliable. Notbook is a little too much investment so you need something affordable and also which do not trouble you later. Dell fulfil this demand. Inspiron 4000, is light compact but still with enough to full fil the demands of day to day life. dell has given me good performance with good mobility, a price which is reasonable and great support from the company. Quality of component is good.(I am based in USA, so check out in India). A good configuration like I have (see below) is around 1500 US $.Its a compatible price. The quality of the things is good. I had problem with my DVD Rom drive and they changed it immidiately. There tech support is also great.

       "      <td>The Inspiron 8000 series represents usually represents the latest technology available for laptops. This is usually Dell's most expensive laptop model as well as it's heaviest model. Overall, the Inspiron 8000 series is meant as a ''desktop replacement'' model.\\n\\nThe Inspiron 8100 model I'm looking at has the following bells and whistles:\\n\\nPentium III-M 866 GHz\\n\\n128 MB of RAM (buy extra RAM from Crucial... high quality and cheaper)\\n\\nGeForce2Go 32 MB\\n\\nDVD/CD-RW Combo drive\\n\\nExtra Battery\\n\\n56K built-in PCI modem with 10/100 network\\n\\nLeather Notebook Case\\n\\nAdditional color face plates\\n\\n15 inch UXGA Screen\\n\\n20 GB HD\\n\\nRunning Windows 2000 with XP coupon upgrade\\n\\nOffice XP SBE\\n\\nThe prices have really dropped since the model was released about a half year ago. The basic 8100 package can run under $1500! But regardless, you know what... this notebook isn't for everyone... there are still some shortcomings on this notebook!\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe Inspiron lives up to legacy of the 8000 model series. It is truly meant to be a Desktop replacement. The new Pentium III-M (I will call it the PIII-M for now on) chips are smaller and run on less electricity. The advances on this processor over the older PIII mobile series means that the PIII-M processor and motherboard is significantly faster than a comparable Pentium III chip. A 866MHz PIII-M chip outpaced my PIII 1 GHz Inspiron 8000 with the exact same hardware configurations running Windows 2000 (using various standard benchmarking tests).\\n\\nThe screen is stunning with the crisp details of the GeForce2Go 32MB card (which may no longer be the top of the heap with the ATI Radeon Mobility 7500 chipset being released)... if you're a big spender you can go for the gusto with the 15.1 inch screen with UGA graphics. The keyboard had an excellent feel and key spacing was not cramped. No burnproof on the DVD/CD-RW though. One battery lasted only 2 1/2 hours still... huh?! What the heck?! I'll get into this a little later...\\n\\nThe notebook is still slower than many comparable desktops however. Likely due to things like a slower hard drive and less powerful video card than you can put into a desktop. The video card in this 8100 was a GeForce2Go 32 MB 4x AGP card. In fact, you can only choose the 16MB or 32MB version of the chipset. This is about the equivalent of a GeForce 2 MX/MX400 card with 32 MB of memory. You are not getting desktop cutting edge graphics... but it's an excellent performer even though the ATI Mobility Radeon 7500 graphics chips have much better specs.\\n\\nSound from the speakers is a bit weak... but this is common to most notebooks with the exception of the Toshiba 2805-S402 notebook and others in the 2805 line. The Toshiba model has a built-in subwoofer... the sound of that Toshiba notebook is plain awesome!\\n\\nAn oddity in DVD playback on the GeForce equipped Inspirion 8000/8100 laptops was that close up viewing of the screen showed a kind of filmly layer to the picture. Colors separated with skin tones especially. This odd coloring with the GeForce2Go detracted from the overall DVD viewing on my Inspiron 8100. Again, like the 8000, running Quake III and other computer games did not exhibit this quality on the notebook screen to any notable degree. I tried The Matrix, Jet Li's Fist of Legend, My Dog Skip, and Dark City with similar results. Funny though, The Simpsons came through in vivid color!\\n\\nThe Inspiron 8100 is still a heavy notebook! It weighs almost 7 lbs if you remove the two optical drives from the unit... however, with this setup of having one optical drive with two batteries, I was looking at more than 8 lbs of computer hardware. The extra battery and DVD/CD-RW drive really add some weight to the computer. This is a hard notebook to carry around. Bring the AC adapter with you and a few other trinkets, you're approaching 9 to 10 lbs.\\n\\nBattery issues (somewhat technical...)\\n\\nMajor problem here! Dell is not using the latest Intel chipsets with the PIII-M in the Inspiron 8100 series and sacrificing the Enhanced Speedstep function of the PIII-M. You sacrifice a chance at enhancing the battery life. There was only a few minutes of difference in running the PIII-M 8100 versus my PIII 8000 notebook. Without chipsets like the i830 in the 8100, the notebook utilizes the PIII-M like a regular mobile PIII. The notebook is using many of the same chips in the original 8000 notebook. So the 8100 is running regular Speedstep instead of the enhanced version on the PIII-M because the Inspiron 8100 doesn't recognize Enhanced Speedstep yet. I'm sure that Dell will correct this sometime in the future, but right now... I feel it's a major problem. Other notebook maker with the PIII-M chips and i830 chipsets are running 3-4 hours with their mid-range and high-range notebooks... a far cry to what the Inspiron 8100 is currently running at. Even the new Inspiron 4100 runs a significantly higher battery time, so far, I've seen up to 3 1/2 hours on that notebook!\\n\\nThe short of it is... you don't get the vaunted long battery life that the processor is capable of!\\n\\nOptions... and more options\\n\\nThe Inspiron 8000 series has many options for it... especially since the line is extremely popular. You can customize and upgrade the notebook quite a bit. All the additional accessories like port replicators and the such. A general rule is that the majority of Inspiron 8000 accessories fit the 8100 with a few minor exceptions... like memory boards.\\n\\nConclusions...\\n\\nAll in all, the Inspiron is a solid performer and great desktop replacement... but it lacks some features that should have been included into the notebook. The lack of an upgraded controller chipset like the i830 in almost unforgivable because it sacrifices that precious battery life! Like many computers these days, it possesses more power than the majority of consumer users will need... gamers, engineers, and graphics specialists will love this notebook. The Inspiron 8100 easily competes with the mid-range desktop segment and even some high-priced/ranged desktop segment. It is powerful enough for games and medium to high-end graphical solutions. You also have a 5 hour portable solution in your hands as well. It's hard to complain with that...\\n\\nThere are other downsides to the Inspiron 8100 from a notebook standpoint. It's bleeding heavy! A fully loaded Inspiron 8100 will weigh more than 8lbs! This is not the easiest of laptops to bring around with you. Customer service is a mixed bag... sometimes excellent service and other times poor service. Not unlike other vendors' customer service however.\\n\\nIf you are buying a notebook to replace a desktop system, this may be a good answer. If you're looking for a supplement for a desktop system, maybe you should think again... the size and weight of the notebook are major factors here. If you are using the notebook for more menial tasks like basic word processing and web surfing... then look at cheaper notebooks like the Inspiron 2100, 2500, and 4000. The new Inspiron 4100 will also suit many tasks especially with the improved battery life with the latest controller chipsets... it may only sport a Radeon Mobility M6 graphics chip but the system definitely packs a wallop! Don't forget those other notebook makers like IBM, Sony, Toshiba, and Compaq... and even the lesser known names like KDS and Sager and WinBook.</td>\n",

As our laptop covers International 3 year warranty. We asked for the support - to add one ZIP Drive to our laptop. We also fired couple of Email and had a telephonic conversation with the concerned sales / Account persons.\\n\\nThe DELL Engineer seems to be not very experienced saying\\n\\nthat external ZIP Drives or CD-RW of other series cannot be supplied as they do not have any part nos. for the DELL Inspirion 5000e Laptops.\\n\\nAll the time we received common prerecorded reply '' This laptop as it is purchased from US, DELL-India does not have any spares for Inspirion 5000e in India.''\\n\\nAnother Incident, we had problem with our Windows Word not getting opened with the error ''Insufficient Memory'' As we were under International warranty, we asked for telephonic support. The DELL-Engineer provided the hints, which never worked at all. We wasted one week after the DELL support. Finally we used the website to get our problem solved.\\n\\nInternational = Inside the nation only\\n\\nAs we have purchased the laptop from US with International warranty, we paid the price for supporting extended warranty on paper + crime for no service as it is outside the limits of US.\\n\\nIs it the International warranty supports only and all the county's within US ????\\n\\nIncompatible with upgrades\\n\\nWe have few incidents with the DELL PC's range. Our good friend has purchased 30 DELL PC's for his office. He wanted to upgrade memory from 64MB to 128MB. He tried with the genuine memory of additional 64MB SIMM from the local market in Bombay. The other brands of memory is not acceptable by DELL PC's. He has no option other than DELL.\\n\\nOther Brand's\\n\\nThis is not found in IBM PC's. We have IBM PC's Netvista A-20 model.

This laptop most of time shows only black screen even after clicking on power button and also this laptop also hangs too much and also unable to install any software on it. This laptop most of time gets defected and also its price is high but quality is very low as compared to other models of laptops I would like to recommend everyone to don't waste time and money for this model of laptop. So don't buy this

       "15577  Desktop or any computer buying is tricky. Problem is the amount needed to invest and then after a few months you feel , I want this in addition or I left this in my purchase. Dell has been given different views by different people I talked. But I say its a good choice. Computer may trouble, no matter which company they are, but an overall view can be deduced. IBM, SONY are too expensive, HP & compaq are not reliable. Notbook is a little too much investment so you need something affordable and also which do not trouble you later. Dell fulfil this demand. Inspiron 4000, is light compact but still with enough to full fil the demands of day to day life. dell has given me good performance with good mobility, a price which is reasonable and great support from the company. Quality of component is good.(I am based in USA, so check out in India). A good configuration like I have (see below) is around 1500 US $.Its a compatible price. The quality of the things is good. I had problem with my DVD Rom drive and they changed it immidiately. There tech support is also great. You can reach them by net also, wherever in world you are and they respond always quickly and do there best, a thing which is really helpful in maintaining your computer

       "15578  I'll tell you what, I've used a good many laptop in my day, being a programmer as well as a law student, and I think this one has been the best yet. I must give DELL kudos first of all. No company has ever given me better, more prompt service than DELL, and the best part is, I've hardly ever needed it. I have certainly enjoyed this little laptop (it's what I'm writing on now). Another good feature of DELL computers id that they don't come with all the useless 'bell and whistle' software that Compaqs or Hewlett-Packards and such do. Most of the install software companies send out as background apps only serve to use up valuable system resources, and I'm glad DELL gives a good, sensible software package where the user can decide what to put on their own machine. Yeah, this laptop has been good to me.

       "15579  The Inspiron 8000 series represents usually represents the latest technology available for laptops. This is usually Dell's most expensive laptop model as well as it's heaviest model. Overall, the Inspiron 8000 series is meant as a ''desktop replacement'' model.\\n\\nThe Inspiron 8100 model I'm looking at has the following bells and whistles:\\n\\nPentium III-M 866 GHz\\n\\n128 MB of RAM (buy extra RAM from Crucial... high quality and cheaper)\\n\\nGeForce2Go 32 MB\\n\\nDVD/CD-RW Combo drive\\n\\nExtra Battery\\n\\n56K built-in PCI modem with 10/100 network\\n\\nLeather Notebook Case\\n\\nAdditional color face plates\\n\\n15 inch UXGA Screen\\n\\n20 GB HD\\n\\nRunning Windows 2000 with XP coupon upgrade\\n\\nOffice XP SBE\\n\\nThe prices have really dropped since the model was released about a half year ago. The basic 8100 package can run under $1500! But regardless, you know what... this notebook isn't for everyone... there are still some shortcomings on this notebook!\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe Inspiron lives up to legacy of the 8000 model series. It is truly meant to be a Desktop replacement. The new Pentium III-M (I will call it the PIII-M for now on) chips are smaller and run on less electricity. The advances on this processor over the older PIII mobile series means that the PIII-M processor and motherboard is significantly faster than a comparable Pentium III chip. A 866MHz PIII-M chip outpaced my PIII 1 GHz Inspiron 8000 with the exact same hardware configurations running Windows 2000 (using various standard benchmarking tests).\\n\\nThe screen is stunning with the crisp details of the GeForce2Go 32MB card (which may no longer be the top of the heap with the ATI Radeon Mobility 7500 chipset being released)... if you're a big spender you can go for the gusto with the 15.1 inch screen with UGA graphics. The keyboard had an excellent feel and key spacing was not cramped. No burnproof on the DVD/CD-RW though. One battery lasted only 2 1/2 hours still... huh?! What the heck?! I'll get into this a little later...\\n\\nThe notebook is still slower than many comparable desktops however. Likely due to things like a slower hard drive and less powerful video card than you can put into a desktop. The video card in this 8100 was a GeForce2Go 32 MB 4x AGP card. In fact, you can only choose the 16MB or 32MB version of the chipset. This is about the equivalent of a GeForce 2 MX/MX400 card with 32 MB of memory. You are not getting desktop cutting edge graphics... but it's an excellent performer even though the ATI Mobility Radeon 7500 graphics chips have much better specs.\\n\\nSound from the speakers is a bit weak... but this is common to most notebooks with the exception of the Toshiba 2805-S402 notebook and others in the 2805 line. The Toshiba model has a built-in subwoofer... the sound of that Toshiba notebook is plain awesome!\\n\\nAn oddity in DVD playback on the GeForce equipped Inspirion 8000/8100 laptops was that close up viewing of the screen showed a kind of filmly layer to the picture. Colors separated with skin tones especially. This odd coloring with the GeForce2Go detracted from the overall DVD viewing on my Inspiron 8100. Again, like the 8000, running Quake III and other computer games did not exhibit this quality on the notebook screen to any notable degree. I tried The Matrix, Jet Li's Fist of Legend, My Dog Skip, and Dark City with similar results. Funny though, The Simpsons came through in vivid color!\\n\\nThe Inspiron 8100 is still a heavy notebook! It weighs almost 7 lbs if you remove the two optical drives from the unit... however, with this setup of having one optical drive with two batteries, I was looking at more than 8 lbs of computer hardware. The extra battery and DVD/CD-RW drive really add some weight to the computer. This is a hard notebook to carry around. Bring the AC adapter with you and a few other trinkets, you're approaching 9 to 10 lbs.\\n\\nBattery issues (somewhat technical...)\\n\\nMajor problem here! Dell is not using the latest Intel chipsets with the PIII-M in the Inspiron 8100 series and sacrificing the Enhanced Speedstep function of the PIII-M. You sacrifice a chance at enhancing the battery life. There was only a few minutes of difference in running the PIII-M 8100 versus my PIII 8000 notebook. Without chipsets like the i830 in the 8100, the notebook utilizes the PIII-M like a regular mobile PIII. The notebook is using many of the same chips in the original 8000 notebook. So the 8100 is running regular Speedstep instead of the enhanced version on the PIII-M because the Inspiron 8100 doesn't recognize Enhanced Speedstep yet. I'm sure that Dell will correct this sometime in the future, but right now... I feel it's a major problem. Other notebook maker with the PIII-M chips and i830 chipsets are running 3-4 hours with their mid-range and high-range notebooks... a far cry to what the Inspiron 8100 is currently running at. Even the new Inspiron 4100 runs a significantly higher battery time, so far, I've seen up to 3 1/2 hours on that notebook!\\n\\nThe short of it is... you don't get the vaunted long battery life that the processor is capable of!\\n\\nOptions... and more options\\n\\nThe Inspiron 8000 series has many options for it... especially since the line is extremely popular. You can customize and upgrade the notebook quite a bit. All the additional accessories like port replicators and the such. A general rule is that the majority of Inspiron 8000 accessories fit the 8100 with a few minor exceptions... like memory boards.\\n\\nConclusions...\\n\\nAll in all, the Inspiron is a solid performer and great desktop replacement... but it lacks some features that should have been included into the notebook. The lack of an upgraded controller chipset like the i830 in almost unforgivable because it sacrifices that precious battery life! Like many computers these days, it possesses more power than the majority of consumer users will need... gamers, engineers, and graphics specialists will love this notebook. The Inspiron 8100 easily competes with the mid-range desktop segment and even some high-priced/ranged desktop segment. It is powerful enough for games and medium to high-end graphical solutions. You also have a 5 hour portable solution in your hands as well. It's hard to complain with that...\\n\\nThere are other downsides to the Inspiron 8100 from a notebook standpoint. It's bleeding heavy! A fully loaded Inspiron 8100 will weigh more than 8lbs! This is not the easiest of laptops to bring around with you. Customer service is a mixed bag... sometimes excellent service and other times poor service. Not unlike other vendors' customer service however.\\n\\nIf you are buying a notebook to replace a desktop system, this may be a good answer. If you're looking for a supplement for a desktop system, maybe you should think again... the size and weight of the notebook are major factors here. If you are using the notebook for more menial tasks like basic word processing and web surfing... then look at cheaper notebooks like the Inspiron 2100, 2500, and 4000. The new Inspiron 4100 will also suit many tasks especially with the improved battery life with the latest controller chipsets... it may only sport a Radeon Mobility M6 graphics chip but the system definitely packs a wallop! Don't forget those other notebook makers like IBM, Sony, Toshiba, and Compaq... and even the lesser known names like KDS and Sager and WinBook.   \n",
       "15580  We have Del Inspirion 5000e Laptop purchased from the USA in March 2000. This product is working good but not as good as Compaq series or IBM notebook.\\n\\nInput Power:\\n\\nMost of the laptops are designed to operate with 110V supply, but can work for 230V supply also.\\n\\nHere is the catch, the power adaptor gets hot too much, it is risky to operate or use the laptop in Non-AC Environment.\\n\\nDisplay:\\n\\nThe Active Display screen does not have good clarity. When Resolution of display is set to 1024 x 768, one cannot get the satisfaction of the hues and colors available with the display settings.\\n\\nInspirion series has Windows Me preloaded while purchase. Many times laptop just hangs for no reason. We need to press the reset button for restart.\\n\\nSupport:\\n\\nDELL in India provides free support via a toll free number 1-600-338045. As our laptop covers International 3 year warranty. We asked for the support - to add one ZIP Drive to our laptop. We also fired couple of Email and had a telephonic conversation with the concerned sales / Account persons.\\n\\nThe DELL Engineer seems to be not very experienced saying\\n\\nthat external ZIP Drives or CD-RW of other series cannot be supplied as they do not have any part nos. for the DELL Inspirion 5000e Laptops.\\n\\nAll the time we received common prerecorded reply '' This laptop as it is purchased from US, DELL-India does not have any spares for Inspirion 5000e in India.''\\n\\nAnother Incident, we had problem with our Windows Word not getting opened with the error ''Insufficient Memory'' As we were under International warranty, we asked for telephonic support. The DELL-Engineer provided the hints, which never worked at all. We wasted one week after the DELL support. Finally we used the website to get our problem solved.\\n\\nInternational = Inside the nation only\\n\\nAs we have purchased the laptop from US with International warranty, we paid the price for supporting extended warranty on paper + crime for no service as it is outside the limits of US.\\n\\nIs it the International warranty supports only and all the county's within US ????\\n\\nIncompatible with upgrades\\n\\nWe have few incidents with the DELL PC's range. Our good friend has purchased 30 DELL PC's for his office. He wanted to upgrade memory from 64MB to 128MB. He tried with the genuine memory of additional 64MB SIMM from the local market in Bombay. The other brands of memory is not acceptable by DELL PC's. He has no option other than DELL.\\n\\nOther Brand's\\n\\nThis is not found in IBM PC's. We have IBM PC's Netvista A-20 model. We are working with these PC's having additional local memory installed in addition to IBM memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "15581  Hi friends, I am discussing about Dell inspiron 15 7560. Everyone knows about the dell, its a brand and milestone company that sell genuine products. This product is very useful with awesome feature. I had used it before 1year ago. Its battery backup is too good, fast work without hanging problem, no heating, fast charging and all these cool feature gives this 5 star rating. So I suggest that buy this product.
