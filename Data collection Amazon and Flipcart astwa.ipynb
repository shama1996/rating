But I think it's a cool laptop.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Speaker placement is superb (right above the keyboard)\\n- Screen is decent (720p but I don't mind)\\n- Keyboard is decent\\n- Has one USB C port and sever legacy ports (hdmi, 2x USB A, SD card slot, headphone port) Awesome versatility!\\n\\nCons:\\n- Trackpad stops working for almost a minute, at least once every hour or two. I usually put the laptop to sleep and then I wake it up again and that resolves it. However, it's not worth the trouble.\\n- Sometimes the brightness buttons don't work. Neither does the brightness slider on Windows either. So the screen stays at a consistent brightness.\\n\\nI like this laptop but I must return it. Trackpad is important to me, especially for working on the go.\\n\\nEvery unit might provide a different experience. Maybe the next unit I purchase will be better and have no remarkable flaws but I won't take that chance. I'll get one from Lenovo for around the same price.\\nRead more\",\n",

As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.\\n\\nThe screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.\\n\\nThe Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.\\n\\nThis is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick. In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.\\n\\nGaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.\\n\\nBuy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.\\n\\nBuild quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.\\n\\nThe screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.\\n\\nI actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.\\n\\nThe keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.\\n\\nThis boots in about 15 seconds.\\n\\nIt has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.\\n\\nThis will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.\\n\\nI can't sing the praises of this enough.\\n\\nBuy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.\\n\\nMake sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.\\n\\nThis is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today\\'s needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).\\nSeems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.\\n\\n2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don\\'t expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.\\n\\nThe back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I\\'ve already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.\\n\\nThe laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.\\n\\nAlmost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.\\n\\nA couple of things that annoy me:\\n-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...\\n-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I\\'ve disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.\\n-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\\nRead more',\n",

But this is exactly what I needed.\\n\\nIt navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.\\n\\nThis computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.\\n\\nTouchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.\\n\\nThe screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.\\n\\nThe Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.\\n\\nThis is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick. In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.\\n\\nGaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.\\n\\nBuy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.\\n\\nBuild quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.\\n\\nThe screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.\\n\\nI actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.\\n\\nThe keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.\\n\\nThis boots in about 15 seconds.\\n\\nIt has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.\\n\\nThis will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.\\n\\nI can't sing the praises of this enough.\\n\\nBuy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.\\n\\nMake sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.\\n\\nThis is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today\\'s needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).\\nSeems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.\\n\\n2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don\\'t expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.\\n\\nThe back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I\\'ve already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.\\n\\nThe laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.\\n\\nAlmost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.\\n\\nA couple of things that annoy me:\\n-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...\\n-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I\\'ve disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.\\n-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\\nRead more',\n",
       " \"I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal. It is like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core. Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy. I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance). The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing.\\n\\nOnce I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year). After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch. The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage. I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1.\\n\\nSomething interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2. I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD.\\n\\nThe BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306.\\n\\nI wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen. That would made it perfect for my needs. It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop.\\n\\nOverall, I would buy it again.\\n\\n[UPDATE 2-3-2021]\\n\\nI installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm. The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively. I just added a screenshot.\\n\\nI did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all is working fine.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nI replaced the wireless card with an Intel Wifi6 AX200(Amazon B07SH6GV5S). This new card does not required me to install drivers at all on Windows 10(although intel recommends to install the latest driver version they provide and I did that), Linux (Kernel 5.8) or Chrome OS, which it's a plus for me. Also, tested on Windows 10 20H2 and found zero issues. Really happy with it. I almost forgot to say that this AX200 card also support Monitor Mode.\\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.\\n\\nQUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.\\n\\nPROS --\\nIncredible Price to Performance Ratio\\nVery well built, with no cheap parts\\nFull-size, comfortable keyboard\\nSmall and lightweight\\nGood design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)\\nFull Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware\\nInternal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot\\nI could keep going... it's $200.\\n\\nCONS --\\nNo backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)\\nSome irksome viewing angle problems\\nMaddeningly little built in storage\\nAlmost too little RAM\\n\\nI've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):\\n\\nIntroduction (above)\\nWeight & Build\\nKeyboard and Trackpad\\nScreen\\nBattery\\nPerformance (including Gaming)\\nWebcam\\nSpeakers & Sound\\nSoftware\\nOther (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)\\nConclusion\\nLinks to Accessories\\n\\nLet me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.\\n\\nThe second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.\\n\\nWith that being said, let me get into the details.\\n\\nWEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.\\n\\nIt's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.\\n\\nThe screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.\\n\\nKEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.\\n\\nAnother note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.\\n\\nAlso, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.\\n\\nThe trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.\\n\\nSCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.\\n\\nThe screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.\\n\\nThere's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.\\n\\nUPDATE: There's seems to be an issue with the screen calibration. Frequently, it will turn noticeably yellow, and by right clicking on the desktop and clicking 'display settings,' it seems to at least temporarily fix it. I believe very much this is a software issue, so it's unlikely you'll encounter it, but it would be interesting to know if others are encountering the same problem.\\n\\nBATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.\\n\\nSide note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.\\n\\nPERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.\\n\\nWell, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.\\n\\nI LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.\\n\\nIMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.\\n\\nI was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.\\n\\nWEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.\\n\\nOf special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.\\n\\nSPEAKERS & SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.\\n\\nIf you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.\\n\\nThe headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.\\n\\nSOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.\\n\\nOTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.\\n\\nOther reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.\\n\\nIt has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.\\n\\nIf you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.\\n\\nDuring normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.\\n\\nSide note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.\\n\\nI like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.\\n\\nEither way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.\\n\\nCONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.\\n\\nLINK TO ACCESSORIES - Some may find this helpful. These are subject to change - Amazon is always adding or removing their product offerings, so if one's not available, these should at least give you an idea of what to look for. But at the time of this writing, these are the accessories I purchased for it, and that all work.\\n\\nSD Card (256gb, $40) - Lots of storage to hold a small collection of movies, music, or pictures. Plenty fast enough.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCR3316/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nLaptop Case ($12) - The laptop fits perfectly.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VVLE5CG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nMicrofiber Clothes ($8) - You can never have too many of these.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050R67U0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nWireless Mouse ($16) - Oddly, the little LEDS in it aren't nearly as bright as advertised, but it's a great mouse. Good click, the scroll wheel is nice. And it has an option between Bluetooth or dongle. Charges off of USB, so no batteries needed.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085HR8VPM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nMessenger Bag ($32) - Fits the Laptop [in the case] like a glove.

       " \"My last 3 phone purchases have been Panasonic phones prior to obtaining the AT&T phones. My main reason for purchasing was the ROBOCALL Blocking feature. Somehow my number got placed on the softheaded list and I was getting robo calls from people who claimed their names were Bob or George but sounded like they were working out of a Bombay call center. Traditional number block features do not work against the scammers, they spoof local numbers. The reviews here on sound clarity and range also convinced me to try AT&T. I did not have a problem with the old Panasonic in regard to sound clarity , but I bought an extra system for my sister who has issues with her current system. I got tired of asking her to repeat what she was telling me on phone conversations. I will list the Pros in their level of importance:\\n\\nRobo call block feature and call screening and call anounce for non caller identified numbers, numbers in your phonebook can pass through unscreened , or with screening. This feature justifies purchasing this phone and dealing with it's detractions.\\n\\nDuplex voice operatioon, unlike most speaker phones both parties can speak simoultaneously. This is a great feature.\\nGood backlight on the numerals which are clear on a black button ( Other controls are not backlit or illuminated)\\n\\nTransmission distance is excellent tested by intercom from inside the house through brick walls to about 100 feet outside.\\nSound clarity is OK\\nHandset is sleek, slim and light\\n\\nNow the cons\\nThe battery is proprietary, it's small and it does not retain a charge for very long. If you forget to place the handset in the cradle charger at night, forget about using the phone the next day. I prefer Panasonic's system which uses two AAA rechargable batteries which last for days.\\n\\nCannot stand the phone up. The panasonic handsets are made so that you can set the phone upright on your desk or table taking up less real estate and making the phone easier to locate.\\nIntercom system is clunky, You have to scroll through 7 to 10 keystrokes to intercom another handset.\\n\\nSpeakerphone cannot be engaged when intercomming another handset until they answer the page and there is a slight delay where both parties greet each other several times before a conversation occurs if both are using speaker phone.\\n\\nCannot name the individual handsets. Panasonic allows handsets to be individualized and this makes intercomming and call transfering much easier. Instead of guessing or remembering who is handset 4.\\n\\nNo individual quiet or sleep mode on the handsets. If you engage sleep mode it is global. If you have a handset in a bedroom and do not wish to be awakened but wish to have other family members recieve calls, it's not possible. Panasonic allows for individualized sleep mode and they can be set to specific times. The AT&T has a timer, it's clunky, ie: sleep for 1 hour, 2 hour etc....\\n\\nSound clarity is ok. Not fantastic. Intercomming by lower level phone leaves something to be desired. Sound volume is lacking, the recipient has to talk noticably louder than when using the panasonic phone and even has to pick the phone up to speak making the speaker phone feature questionable. I do not know if it is distance from the base transmitter, the phone remains in ECO mode which appears to be global or perhpas it is just a display feature that does nothing? Conversly we tested distance and clarity was good from inside the house through brick walls to 100 feet outside.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'The set up was super simple, and the smart block feature is the best! Since installing the system, I finally have peace and quiet from the annoying robo calls.

With the ability to set the phone to screen all incoming calls, requiring the caller to speak his or her name and then hit the # sign, no more nonsense calls get through.

The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go.

       " \"Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.\\n\\nWith a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.\\n\\nDue diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.\\n\\nThe sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.\\n\\nBattery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.\\n\\nPairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.\\n\\nAll in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'Wow. These are absolutely phenomenal headphones. I bought them about a year and a half ago and I use them all the time. I had a pair of on ear headphones from a no-name brand a few years ago and, while they served their purpose, they were not impressively loud and became a little aggravating on the ears after a while. These sit very comfortably on my head while I do chores around the house or yard work etc. I run a mobile auto detailing business in my spare time and use them for that as well. I don’t have a particularly large head and they fit nicely, but I imagine they would be better for someone with a big noggin. If I find myself looking down for too long they will start to slip off my head. I wouldn’t even attempt to do any kind of cardio with these. Weightlifting, sure but running - no. They are too loose and when using the noise canceling feature, any excess movement makes it crackle.\\n\\nThe noise canceling is pretty decent. It’s not Bose quality but it’s plenty powerful to muffle a mower, vacuum or grinder. It almost entirely mutes plane noise. Like I mentioned, it doesn’t take much jostling to make it crackle, but if it becomes too annoying I just turn the NC off.\\n\\nSound quality is also pretty good. Depending on the app/song I’m listening to, it can get EXTREMELY loud. So much so that I have to turn it down - which is saying something because I listen to my music on full blast most of the time. Sound quality is marginally better with the NC on, but marginally louder with NC off.\\n\\nBuild construction is solid enough. Kind of feels like a few steps up from just cheap plastic. Don’t get me wrong - it IS cheap plastic but it presents itself well. Pads are very soft and so far the body has been durable. I’ve dropped these on the ground a few times and, while they are covered in scratches, they are still performing fabulously.\\n\\nFinally, and very importantly, the battery life on these is UNPRECEDENTED. I mean I will use these for hours a day for like 2 weeks in a row before even thinking about charging them. I think they advertise 16 hours, but no joke I have probably used these for 40+ hours between charges and they still weren’t dead. Unbelievable. There is also a widget for the iPhone but I’ve found it to be entirely inaccurate.\\n\\nBluetooth connection is lightning fast and has superb distance. In an open field I’ve used them further than 80’ from my phone.\\n\\nGripes: I have only a few.\\nMy biggest gripe is the piss poor Siri support. There is not a designated Siri button which sucks. And it wouldn’t be so bad, but there is about a 4 second delay between Siri activation and the prompt to begin speaking. I hope they addressed this with the E8’s.\\n\\nThere is an LED on the command switch that never turns off and is quite bright. Also not a huge deal, but it bothers my wife if I try to wear them in bed.\\n\\nLastly, the hinges of the earpieces have become a little squeaky and loose after a year. Overall, these are minute gripes that I actually had to think about to put in here.\\n\\nOverall these are a fantastic set of headphones and have earned their 5-stars from me. I bought another product from Cowin and had to get in touch with their customer support and was very pleased. I will buy from Cowin in the future\\n\\nUpdate: 10-11-18\\n\\nI am still using these headphones and continue to be blown away by their deceptively good quality. I mean these suckers refuse to die. I’ve added a few photos this time to show how much abuse they’ve taken over the past few years. The leather is gnarled over the headpiece. There are scratches everywhere. I’ve even dropped this pair off my roof by accident. They didn’t care. They laughed and kept playing the ‘Man of Steel’ film score. Not even joking - that really happened. The battery life remains miraculous. Still getting 30+ hours of play time on full volume. That is an absolute feat considering the common life of Li-Ion batteries. The buttons still work. The Noise Cancelling still works. And despite their twisted appearance, they remain unconventionally comfortable. In my previous post I mentioned that they had started to squeak around the hinges. Yeah that just stopped. I am seriously astounded by these headphones and wonder if I’ll ever even need to upgrade to the E8’s. In any case - Cowin has still got my vote when it comes down to a reasonably priced headphone of extraordinary longevity.\\n\\nUpdate: 12-17-19\\n\\nMy (probably) final thoughts:\\nThese headphones have transcended my expectations in quality - So much so that I’ve anthropomorphized them. Yup they’re basically my buddy. I have been using these every day for 3 YEARS and have not had one single issue with them. Sure the skin is falling off.. And... uh... yeah nope that’s it. That’s literally the only problem plaguing these headphones. I was broke when I bought these (still broke but that’s not relevant) and they have gone above and beyond their purpose for how much I paid for them. The battery STILL lasts days, the sound quality has not diminished at all, and I am still beating the snot out of these things. I was expecting these to last MAYBE 18 months before I had to search for something else. 3 years later, I’m now looking into a pair of AirPods to replace my dailies, but I’ll be keeping these as backups and for studio work - probably forever. I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon (remember that thing about being broke?) but I hold these headphones with the utmost respect as possibly the best purchase I’ve ever made on this site.\\n\\nCowin - you guys are doing something right. You’ve made a lifelong customer and I can’t recommend your products enough. Well done.\\n\\nNow go buy these headphones!\\n\\nUpdate: 05-31-20\\n\\nUn...Be...Lievable.\\n\\nIn the time since my last update, I have acquired a set of AirPod Pros. In that same amount of time, they have died. 3 whole months of daily use and they decided not to work anymore. They were 250$. 3 months. I mentioned in my last update that I’d be keeping my E7’s as a set of backups and, well, it has come to be. And THEY STILL WORK LIKE THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM. ARE YOU KIDDING ME COWIN!? The ear pieces have worn off, exposing cloth underneath the leather. This does cause them to hold moisture a lot from sweating (and uh.. smell too..) but that’s the only development in the problems department. I have never had a consumer electronic blow me away the way these headphones have. I LOVE them. Unfortunately I’m out 250 bucks on my AirPods but I learned my lesson. I’ll be ordering a new set of headphones soon, and you bet your butt I’ll be ordering some Cowins.\\nRead more',\n",

It paired up quickly with my HP Laptop on the first attempt without any hesitation. The fit and finish is near perfect in my opinion. The attractive brushed aluminum frame is very attractive, well padded and oh so smooth to the touch. It came with a nice leather like travel bag, a cord for direct connection to a cell phone, laptop or other similar device and a USB cable for charging the lithium battery. After performing a good long over night first-time battery charge, I used them for six continuous hours glorious comfortable hours. There was no fading of sound and the battery seemed to be ready for several more hours of use. The volume control is smooth and adjusts easily. The sound remained clear, crisp and easy to listen to from the highest to the lowest volume setting.\\n\\nComparable headphones at Walmart are mych more expensive and their cheaper ones are...well, cheap for a reason.

       " \"I had a pair from this headphone line in the past, and used them until they basically fell apart (one side stopped working, and the cushioning material for the ears eventually peeled away.) And yet after trying myriad other brands, I rate these as my personal best. After my first pair died (took several years of daily use), I went on a quest to try a bunch of different headphones. After wasting hundreds of dollars over the past couple years on everything from fancy $200 pairs, cheap Amazon-branded pairs, and plenty of random ones from places like Big Lots or Walmart, I finally just came back to these for a meager $15. There's simply no beating the combination of comfort (especially for people with glasses!), sound quality, and price. I work in front of a computer for hours at a time, and almost always have headphones (and eye glasses) on. I probably have a larger than average head shape too. Every single other pair I have tried ended up making my ears hurt before long, except this one. While the construction quality is decent, I do expect to run through a new pair every couple years, but at this price point, it's really hard to complain. In summary, I am so thankful these are back in my life.\",\n",
       " 'These phones sound really nice, for being under $20. I have owned at least 30 different headphones since 1974, and these sound as good as any of the $100 Sennheisers I had back when Elton John\\'s \"Rocket Man\" was new music. The power requirement for the voice coils in these phones is remarkably low: They sound great for listening to music on a cell phone or tablet, and you won\\'t even have to crank the volume up to maximum. Some of the headphones I have owned recently don\\'t work well with mobile devices, requiring more output power than the audio chip in a cell phone can provide - that won\\'t be a problem with these Sony ZX-110 phones. They sound just fine on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S at 50% of max volume. Frequency response is very good for economy priced phones, with clear treble and adequate bass response to let you \"feel\" the drums and bass guitar. Soprano and contralto vocals sound nice and clear, without that \"muddy\" sound that cheap phones give that don\\'t have enough high-frequency response. These phones fold up into a very small, compact footprint that is easy to store in a medium or large purse, or any briefcase, backpack, or laptop computer bag. The cord is 3 feet, and has a 90° angled plug. This cord length is great for use with a cell phone in a shirt pocket, although not really long enough for home use with a desktop computer. If you are going to use these phones to listen to music on a home stereo or desktop computer, you will need an extension cord, but these aren\\'t terribly expensive.\\nCOMFORT: Sony got this right: these phones grip your head just firmly enough to stay in place, without squeezing you to death. I have had a couple of Sony phones that were horrible in this respect, with way too much compression on an average sized head; that\\'s not a problem with these phones. The ear pads are very comfortable, and they don\\'t press hard enough on your earlobes to make you need to take your earrings off to use the phones.\\n\\nSUMMARY: A Typical Sony economy-priced headphone with much better sound than you might have expected at this price point. Folds up very small for carrying in a purse or laptop computer bag, Very comfortable to wear for up to several hours.\\n\\nPRODUCT RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\\nRead more',\n",

       " 'UPDATE: 1/15/21 Both headphones are still going strong. Just thought I\\'d update after my daughter has had her\\'s for a decent amount of time.\\nUPDATE: 10/14/20 Bought a 2nd pair for our 3rd grader to use at school. Originally, we bought her the lightweight, on ear styled, Koss brand headphones on here, but she thought they were too tight and uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. Especially because she wears glasses, and now a mask as well. She loved these tho! Said they felt great, and has been using them at school for just over 6weeks with no problems.\\n\\nORIGINAL: We bought these for my mother in-law to use with her t.v. because she is starting to become hard of hearing. We wanted to check everything out before setting everything up for her, and we found these were made well, had good sound volume and quality, were comfortable for a decent length of time, and overall were good headphones. She wanted to have two different styles. These were the one style that she was able to use in her 3.5mm tablet as well, which was an added bonus. She had hoped both pairs would work in her tablet, but the on ear computer style Panasonic did not fit, but still works for the t.v. set up, which was her main concern. The Panasonic had a smaller pin, so it might have worked in a cell phone. She did not try it, but I will update once she does. I wish we had thought to try ourselves. We purchased everything on Amazon for her setup. This pair fit all of our heads and have a lot of adjustability. They do show which way to put them on by marking the back of the ear pad section with \"L\" for left & \"R\" right, as shown in my photos. These are decently padded, and if taken care of should last. Overtime, this padded material may start to crack and chip away, but they\\'re pretty good for this value. The Panasonic ones were more lightweight when wearing for long periods, so she\\'s still glad she got both pair.

       " 'Wow. These are absolutely phenomenal headphones. I bought them about a year and a half ago and I use them all the time. I had a pair of on ear headphones from a no-name brand a few years ago and, while they served their purpose, they were not impressively loud and became a little aggravating on the ears after a while. These sit very comfortably on my head while I do chores around the house or yard work etc. I run a mobile auto detailing business in my spare time and use them for that as well. I don’t have a particularly large head and they fit nicely, but I imagine they would be better for someone with a big noggin. If I find myself looking down for too long they will start to slip off my head. I wouldn’t even attempt to do any kind of cardio with these. Weightlifting, sure but running - no. They are too loose and when using the noise canceling feature, any excess movement makes it crackle.\\n\\nThe noise canceling is pretty decent. It’s not Bose quality but it’s plenty powerful to muffle a mower, vacuum or grinder. It almost entirely mutes plane noise. Like I mentioned, it doesn’t take much jostling to make it crackle, but if it becomes too annoying I just turn the NC off.\\n\\nSound quality is also pretty good. Depending on the app/song I’m listening to, it can get EXTREMELY loud. So much so that I have to turn it down - which is saying something because I listen to my music on full blast most of the time. Sound quality is marginally better with the NC on, but marginally louder with NC off.\\n\\nBuild construction is solid enough. Kind of feels like a few steps up from just cheap plastic. Don’t get me wrong - it IS cheap plastic but it presents itself well. Pads are very soft and so far the body has been durable. I’ve dropped these on the ground a few times and, while they are covered in scratches, they are still performing fabulously.\\n\\nFinally, and very importantly, the battery life on these is UNPRECEDENTED. I mean I will use these for hours a day for like 2 weeks in a row before even thinking about charging them. I think they advertise 16 hours, but no joke I have probably used these for 40+ hours between charges and they still weren’t dead. Unbelievable. There is also a widget for the iPhone but I’ve found it to be entirely inaccurate.\\n\\nBluetooth connection is lightning fast and has superb distance. In an open field I’ve used them further than 80’ from my phone.\\n\\nGripes: I have only a few.\\nMy biggest gripe is the piss poor Siri support. There is not a designated Siri button which sucks. And it wouldn’t be so bad, but there is about a 4 second delay between Siri activation and the prompt to begin speaking. I hope they addressed this with the E8’s.\\n\\nThere is an LED on the command switch that never turns off and is quite bright. Also not a huge deal, but it bothers my wife if I try to wear them in bed.\\n\\nLastly, the hinges of the earpieces have become a little squeaky and loose after a year. Overall, these are minute gripes that I actually had to think about to put in here.\\n\\nOverall these are a fantastic set of headphones and have earned their 5-stars from me. I bought another product from Cowin and had to get in touch with their customer support and was very pleased. I will buy from Cowin in the future\\n\\nUpdate: 10-11-18\\n\\nI am still using these headphones and continue to be blown away by their deceptively good quality. I mean these suckers refuse to die. I’ve added a few photos this time to show how much abuse they’ve taken over the past few years. The leather is gnarled over the headpiece. There are scratches everywhere. I’ve even dropped this pair off my roof by accident. They didn’t care. They laughed and kept playing the ‘Man of Steel’ film score. Not even joking - that really happened. The battery life remains miraculous. Still getting 30+ hours of play time on full volume. That is an absolute feat considering the common life of Li-Ion batteries. The buttons still work. The Noise Cancelling still works. And despite their twisted appearance, they remain unconventionally comfortable. In my previous post I mentioned that they had started to squeak around the hinges. Yeah that just stopped. I am seriously astounded by these headphones and wonder if I’ll ever even need to upgrade to the E8’s. In any case - Cowin has still got my vote when it comes down to a reasonably priced headphone of extraordinary longevity.\\n\\nUpdate: 12-17-19\\n\\nMy (probably) final thoughts:\\nThese headphones have transcended my expectations in quality - So much so that I’ve anthropomorphized them. Yup they’re basically my buddy. I have been using these every day for 3 YEARS and have not had one single issue with them. Sure the skin is falling off.. And... uh... yeah nope that’s it. That’s literally the only problem plaguing these headphones. I was broke when I bought these (still broke but that’s not relevant) and they have gone above and beyond their purpose for how much I paid for them. The battery STILL lasts days, the sound quality has not diminished at all, and I am still beating the snot out of these things. I was expecting these to last MAYBE 18 months before I had to search for something else. 3 years later, I’m now looking into a pair of AirPods to replace my dailies, but I’ll be keeping these as backups and for studio work - probably forever. I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon (remember that thing about being broke?) but I hold these headphones with the utmost respect as possibly the best purchase I’ve ever made on this site.\\n\\nCowin - you guys are doing something right. You’ve made a lifelong customer and I can’t recommend your products enough. Well done.\\n\\nNow go buy these headphones!\\n\\nUpdate: 05-31-20\\n\\nUn...Be...Lievable.\\n\\nIn the time since my last update, I have acquired a set of AirPod Pros. In that same amount of time, they have died. 3 whole months of daily use and they decided not to work anymore. They were 250$. 3 months. I mentioned in my last update that I’d be keeping my E7’s as a set of backups and, well, it has come to be. And THEY STILL WORK LIKE THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM. ARE YOU KIDDING ME COWIN!? The ear pieces have worn off, exposing cloth underneath the leather. This does cause them to hold moisture a lot from sweating (and uh.. smell too..) but that’s the only development in the problems department. I have never had a consumer electronic blow me away the way these headphones have. I LOVE them. Unfortunately I’m out 250 bucks on my AirPods but I learned my lesson. I’ll be ordering a new set of headphones soon, and you bet your butt I’ll be ordering some Cowins.\\nRead more',\n",

Bought two pair, the other one for my wife.\\n\\nThe Cowin E-7 is a beautifully crafted, very comfortable, noise cancelling headphone and the sound quality everything I had hoped for. It paired up quickly with my HP Laptop on the first attempt without any hesitation. The fit and finish is near perfect in my opinion. The attractive brushed aluminum frame is very attractive, well padded and oh so smooth to the touch. It came with a nice leather like travel bag, a cord for direct connection to a cell phone, laptop or other similar device and a USB cable for charging the lithium battery. After performing a good long over night first-time battery charge, I used them for six continuous hours glorious comfortable hours. There was no fading of sound and the battery seemed to be ready for several more hours of use. The volume control is smooth and adjusts easily. The sound remained clear, crisp and easy to listen to from the highest to the lowest volume setting.\\n\\nComparable headphones at Walmart are mych more expensive and their cheaper ones are...well, cheap for a reason.

       " \"The best of two worlds - it can be both wireless and wired\\n\\nI have been struggling to find the perfect headphones, mostly because I love the wireless ones for their convenience: that you can move around the house and listen to music/audiobooks while your phone is charging, at the same time, I am constantly forgetting to charge the headphones. Wired headphones will never turn off, but you are literally attached to the source of music. That's why these headphones have become a perfect option for me, and their first benefit is:\\n\\nCONVENIENCE. These headphones come with a standard 3.5mm cable, so when the battery is out, you can simply plug the cable in, and continue using them! For someone like me, it's a great find. So far, with the cable attached, the sound comes only from one dynamic though, but it's good enough for me, especially if I'm listening to an audiobook in the middle of my daily walk.\\n\\nSOUND. I really liked the sound - it's very clear as if someone is singing directly in your ear 🙂 Everything sounds great in them so far: from classical music to Rammstein.\\n\\nNOISE CANCELLATION. These headphones already offer partial noise cancellation because of their over-the-ear design, but with ANC turned on, it's even better! It completely blocked out the sounds of a lawn mower outside while I was testing them. So they are really effective.\\n\\nFIT. I liked that the shape of the over-the-ear pieces is oval, and kind of mimicking the shape of the ear. The fit is nice and soft, not too tight, not too loose, just perfect. I can wear them for a long time.\\n\\nCONTROLS. Unlike some of my other headphones, these ones provide a lot of control functions, for example, you can pause a song, skip to the next one, adjust volume, and answer the calls. I love it because with my previous headphones, I could only adjust the volume and turn them on and off.\\n\\nPACKAGING. The packaging is nice and stylish. It comes in a black box with a silver drawing of the headphones, and inside there is a neat case that you can use later to carry the headphones in your bag or a backpack and not worry about them being scratched or damaged. The package also has a charging cable, a 3.5mm cable, and a pretty straightforward instruction.\\n\\nI am happy with these headphones so far, I hope they serve me for a long time because I really like them.\\nRead more\",\n",

I have never had a pair of bluetooth headphones with such a short range before period with the other ones I've had in the past if I got say on the other side of the house my connection would not be great, but they at least worked in the same room and one room over. I cannot leave my phone charging while listening to Pandora with these headphones while I clean because my phone has to remain in my pocket in order for it to work. I really wanted to love these because the case is small and compact and they look nice in the sound quality is overall pretty they can take a little adjusting to get in my ear properly and they aren't the most comfortable ones I've ever worn,they can take a little adjusting to get in my ear properly and they aren't the most comfortable ones I've ever worn, but they aren't terrible either. however, between the comfort and the lack of range I would say these are worth at best $15. I didn't expect too much for the price, but I expected the issue to be more with battery life than the range. They will work for now, but I will definitely need to upgrade to a better pair in the near future which kind of makes this feel like a waste of money.\\nRead more\",\n",

They tend to vary in quality a lot so I get a little hesitant to buy off name brands. On the other hand, I have been careless with losing them and the name brands cost a lot to replace. So I tried these after seeing the positive reviews and really concur with the general sentiment of the other reviews. They feel well made. They pair easily and I haven't had any connectivity issues. They sound good in both mids and bass. I used them for exercise a couple of days and never ran into any battery life issues.\\n\\nSome comments. The USB-C cord is very short. I guess this didn't bother me at all since I have a lot of cords already. The microphone was just ok.

       " \"Disclosure: I was an audio professional for many years and have numerous local and regional radio and TV credits, and did both location and studio recording.\\n\\nThese inexpensive headphones purport to be 'studio monitor' headphones and I have evaluated them as such. My gold standard is the Sony MDR-V6, which 30 years ago sold for almost four times the price; today's Sony professional headphones, the best in the business, sell for the expected higher prices.\\n\\nA studio headphone is definitely NOT a headphone made for 'listening' per se. Most consumer headphones for listening have frequency responses tailored to the intended audience. For instance the Beats headphones put out a strong bass (as do many others). Studio headphones must tell the truth; that is, they must have a flat, wide range response with no colorations, no phase distortions, and no intentional emphases. The engineer needs to hear exactly what's going on, exactly as it sounds.\\n\\nStudio headphones also need to be comfortable. If you're sitting offstage recording three hours of opera, the headphones had better not pinch, give headaches, cause sweating, or otherwise irritate and detract attention from a demanding job requiring constant focus.\\n\\nThe Amazon studio headphones fail, as studio headphones, on most every count.\\n\\nThe bass, while tight and solid, is over-emphasized. The lower mids are murky and the frequency response rolls off so there is no transparency and the barest of high end response. This in turn makes the sound stage narrow and constricted. Fortunately there is no phasiness. But overall the sound is unacceptably inaccurate, and not even especially pleasant, over a wide variety of source material.\\n\\nComfort is not good, either. The headphones are way too tight and give an instant headache. The top bar is not padded on the underside and feels like a hard object pressing into the top of your head, which is exactly what it is. THe headphones are also hot. I couldn't imagine using these over the course of a multi-hour performance. I will say that the acoustic isolation is excellent.\\n\\nThe headphones are supplied with a coiled cord that extends nicely, and a quarter inch adapter for the eighth inch plug.\\n\\nBut for the price, would you really expect to get good studio monitor headphones? I certainly wouldn't. And in fact, you don't. These might not be bad for listening to some music on a casual basis, but if you use them in a professional setting, you're risking your reputation and maybe your career.\\nRead more\",\n",

They were $60 and offered a $15 off coupon discount and an additional promo code, knocking the headphones down to $15. However, the third party seller didn't want to honor the new price.

       " 'First of all a complaint, and one that shouldn\\'t be. The watch face on this is awful, hard to see, and with the design, hard to find out what the time is quickly. I don\\'t get it many of the other screens are brightly colored and well designed, plus easy to read. This is a watch after all so shouldn\\'t the watch part be better. Unfortunately, unlike some other iWatches, you cannot change the primary watch face graphic. That said there are a number of other things that make this worth owning. You have a typical pulse rate monitor, and a blood pressure checker, this is enough for some medically centered smart watches. It however, adds value with some more unusual functions. Although one is dependent on the cell phone app link to use. ECG, (electro cardiogram) is a feature that tracks the pulse rhythm to see if the heart is beating properly and efficiently. To take you need to either tighten the band up or push down on the watch face to maintain contact till the test finishes. In the app it draws a charted graph much like you get at a doctors office and gives an analysis of the wave recorded. It seemed pretty good, but I\\'m not sure this is medical grade, but it maybe be close. Another nice feature is the blood Oxygen monitor. I have one for my finger, and this is close, the sensor array is good to take quick readings. The sleep monitor is a bit off I think, I have a BiPAP machine which gives more accurate results and this seems way off. It doesn\\'t seem to actually know when I\\'m sleeping.\\n\\nThe watch is water resistant, and to maintain that has a fairly unusual charging USB cable. An \"A\" typical USB end on one end, and to the watch a dual pin, magnetic connection to hold the end in place. It charges quickly in an hour or so and then lasts for days. Some of the features are poorly interfaced in the cell phone APP, I was able to use them a bit more as I kept experimenting with them. A better manual would be nice, although as these things go this maybe better than most. Very inexpensive with all the medical and sports driven devices. Given the bargain nature I may have given 4.5-5 stars had the watch face not been so bad. Recommended.\\nRead more',\n",

With a larger dial you can reach a fair bit of the notification messages and get the caller info on the dial.\\nThe accuracy rate was on point! The heart rate monitor matched up to the treadmill as well as the distance and calories burned. The simplicity of your stats on the screen are fantastic. One of the main features that I appreciate about my new watch is tracking steps, calories, mileage, and hours of sleep. I am a pretty active person, I enjoyed my watch on a hike. Does great tracking steps. Heart rate control is also a feature that is helpful during exercise or during moments that I might feel anxious or overwhelmed.\\nI am really enjoying my new watch! Honestly at $40 this one, which is waterproof, is a clear winner and I LOVE it even more. Waterproofness is 100 percent. For money great watch. Control of music is a great feature, which allows me to stop the music while I cannot find my phone. Another favorite feature is being able to find my phone around with my watch. It was package well upon arrival.\\nOverall, it's pretty fancy for the price. There is nothing you can complain about the price point on this watch if you are on a budget. The price is very affordable and color options allow you to style it easily. The build quality is really spot on, with the aluminum housing and nice rubber-like watch band.

The watch face it not to big and even with my eyesight problems I can read the text that comes through. It was very easy to set up and has so far done everything I expect from it. The sleep mode is accurate as well as the BP. (off by 1-2 points by my cuff) everything else is pretty much spot on. The band is comfy and I do take it off in the morning for a bit and put it back on after a shower. The only thing I would change is the face pictures themselves. I have gone through all of them and there a ton of them and only like a few of them. Most are sports related in some way or another.

The watch is rechargeable by USB. It is easily set through the touch screen. The face of the watch is a square with a 1 x 1/4” screen.

No. The steps are spot on as well. I visually watch it count my steps on the Samsung health app. What is awesome is now the new bezel feature... Which allows you to quickly access other apps and change the volume with music. The music is awesome too because I connected it to my Spotify account and it will play your Spotify music on the watch when you're away from you phone. The only downside is bixby... Samsung has really gotta work out the kinks on that one... Terrible voice recognition. However, overall I love it! Lots of improvements compared to the last one 😄 P.S.

That might have been user error.\\n3. This watch allows you to delete messages, many other don’t! Who wants old messages floating around on their watch?\\n4. Had trouble with other brands not saving settings (imperial vs metric, Fahrenheit vs Celsius). I have not had any problems with this app, PubuFit, even though the app looks exactly like the other apps (HerobandIII).\\n5. I’m tall and this app lets me input my stride length to more accurately count steps!\\n6. More faces than most others so even tho not custom, can manage to find ones that work.\\n7. I mentioned the charger as a plus but after trying others with a small plug like attachment that falls off if you move it, this one is far superior. It stays attached! Full charge from 8% to 100% in 3 hours.\\n8. Swapping out with a quick change 20mm slim style band has made all the difference for me with my small 6” wrist.\\n9. If the BP & sleep readings were closer to accurate I’d give it 5 stars. They are “fun” to look at but nowhere near reality.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\nPurchased to use for blood pressure reading and message notification. Neither work. I emailed company and they agreed that the BP isn’t accurate and no way to calibrate it. The watch no longer buzzes when I get phone notifications, so the two reasons for purchasing are useless. Still on same charge 4 days in.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Wide variety of faces\\n-Fits comfortably on my small wrist\\n-Quick release bands can be swapped out\\n-Nice charger and connection\\n-Holds battery for a long time\\n\\nCons:\\n-Buzz for notifications stopped working\\n-Sleep does not detect when I am awake at night (even getting up to go to the bathroom and moving registers as light sleep)\\n-Blood pressure readings so far from accurate they aren’t even a guide\\n-Faces are not customizable\\n\\nIf you want a cute led watch then this works.

I'm a photographer so sun up/sun down is really important, and I'm constantly losing my phone in my truck or in my couch cushions. Really nice to be able to press a button on the watch and have the phone ring.

I haven't tested the waterproof qualities because I like it too much to risk it. It's held up well to sweat and yard work though.\\n\\nThe pedometer doesn't seem to be extremely accurate, but the instructions specifically mention how you can calibrate that, I just haven't done it yet.\\n\\nThe app seems to be pretty on par with what you could expect from fitbit or similar fitness watch companies, just less ads and spam built in. Haven't had to do too much with the app yet, but it contains some settings for the watch.\\n\\nBattery life seems to be about 3-4 days but I've been charging it before it dies. Takes an hour or less, so I just charge it while I'm doing work on my computer.\\n\\nI really love how this thing looks. Very classy, and the weight from the metal housing makes it feel like a high quality watch. Very impressed, and I'd expect them to raise the price very soon on these as they grow in popularity. I'd absolutely buy another model from them in the future as this technology becomes cheaper to produce.\\n\\nMy only criticism is the slight wonkiness of the message notifications which might even get fixed with a firmware update at some point. It just doesn't integrate well with my 3rd party SMS app, but that's not a huge deal. I tend to get a buzz on the watch whenever I get some kind of call or message, so it's overall not too much of a detractor for me.\\n\\nI was considering a galaxy watch, but there's seriously no need to spend that much now that I have this thing.

You can turn the volume up and down, stop and play the music and push forward or back. You cannot see which music is playing.\\n2.-The phone vibrates when there is an income call or message. You can see the message, but it is hard to scroll up and down to read. Sometimes it gets a little bit stuck. But that\\'s ok for me. I just need to be notified that I have a message and who sent it. The rest I can do it from my phone. You cannot reply back from your watch.\\n3.- It has an alarm that you set up in the app you install on your phone. I prefer to wake up with my watch vibrating than listening to the annoying sound of an alarm clock.\\n4.- It counts your steps and calories burned.\\n5.- It has a bunch of options for sports. After selecting the sport of your preference, it counts the calories burned, bpm, and active time.\\n6.- It has a timer\\n7.- it measures your heart rate, and it seems pretty accurate.\\n8.-It can track your sleep and tells you if you had a deep sleep or a light sleep. This function was hard to find because there is not such a thing as a \"sleep tracker\" in the watch. The sleep function is installed in the phone by default, and you find it by pressing the tab \"sports\" in the app and then pressing \"Healthy.\" It took me two days playing with the app to figure it out.\\n9.- Battery life says that last seven days. I have been using this watch for three days in a row, and today it still has around 70%, so I guess it will last until day 7.\\n10.- It says it is water-resistant, but I prefer not to mess with that, and I don\\'t think I will put it underwater, so I take it off when showering\\n11.- The smartwatch is very light and comfortable.

I’m sure we will get it figured out eventually. Other than that I am very happy. Great seller. Answers questions expeditiously.',\n",

       " 'Just beginning to look at and put all together. New to digital cameras so gonna take some time but excited about getting going. Have always wanted one and am 64 years old and decided not getting any younger and to go for it do something I will enjoy and for myself.',\n",
       " 'I wanted a good way to get started in higher end cameras from the point and shoot ones, but not yet ready to drop $1500+ on a new pro camera yet. I decided to get this one after reading a number of reviews and looking through several reviews and other similar kits. This one had a good starter kit, but still not knowing how to set aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc (I only used auto-mode) , I was looking forward to getting a real-camera. I really wanted to be able to take hi-res beautiful pics and enjoy my new hobby.\\nSome comments on the kit itself. First the bad (and why it didn\\'t get 5 stars):\\n1) I really liked the camera body, the T7 (1500D in some regions, 2000D in others, but otherwise the same camera known by 3 different model numbers), but what I didn\\'t know, was the hot-shoe is missing the center pin. Canon decided to remove the center trigger pin so that you had to buy their flash. After tons of research, you can get a Godox trigger model X2T-C TTL and get the normal hot-shoe mount for flashes, plus it is wireless so you can use other compatible flashes. I\\'m not spending $300-400 on a Canon flash when there are plenty of good ones out there that work just fine, especially for a beginner rig like this. $300 would be a different story if I was spending $1500 on a camera body like a Mark series.\\n2) The tripod with this kit is a joke. It extends quite a bit, but it\\'s unstable. Put your $500 camera on it and unless you keep an eye on it, the tripod will topple eventually. I was fine with mine, but if the wind blew, you\\'re screwed. It\\'s a good beginner one, but if you\\'re reading this, get a good medium grade one. I would not advise relying on it. I tried to mount my camera with the legs not extended to take a macro picture. As soon as you tilt down at 45 degrees, the tripod won\\'t hold up the camera and wants to fall over. BEWARE.\\n3) The flash that comes with this is very simple. They don\\'t tell you until you begin to use it: This flash is designed to be a secondary slave flash. There is no way to trigger it with the T7 being sold with this rig. The T7 is a good camera, but I\\'m planning to get a Godox trigger and flash to go with the trigger. I do like the flash slave bar mount that comes with this, but there are better out there. The built in flash is good, but has limited range.\\n4) The description shows you get a FLD filter. Not knowing what this was, I didn\\'t know it mattered. THIS KIT DOES NOT COME WITH A FLD FILTER. The FLD filter is intended to filter for the color change that occurs with indoor florescent lights. The T7 compensates for this anyway. The filters you get are Vivitar (a good economy brand of lens and filter) and are CPL (polarizing for neutralizing reflections, allowing you capture clear water pictures for example), a UV filter (recommended to have for outdoor pics-but many lenses have a UV coating on them already-and as cheap as these are it can be used as a protection for your front lens glass-recommended by Chris Bray and they are cheap so why not), and a ND8 filter (neutral density-more valuable than an FLD filter). The lack of FLD filter was more of an annoyance for me, but filters are generally cheap to buy so I\\'ll just get one, the ND was a nice touch to have.\\n\\nNow for the good:\\n1) The camera case was a good starter, but it\\'s hard to put all the items in the bag. I am in the process of ordering a backpack to store my items in it.\\n2) This kit comes with 1 lens, and good general starter lens that goes from 18mm (portraits) to the beginning of telephoto range (50mm) at 55mm. Having tried a USM focus lens (ultrasonic-said to be fast) it sounds like mice or rats are in your lens chattering away. My STM (stepper motor) is quick and quiet. I prefer it over the cheaper quality USM.\\n3) Some of the other accessories that came like the 2x 32GB Sandisk memory cards (a good brand as opposed to the cheaper (quality in doubt) starter accessories that came with the kit from the seller, it worked well.\\n4) The extra battery and mini-charger (plugs into the wall or in the car) was a nice touch also. I\\'m going to invest in an external power connection for studio operation. That goes with getting flash and diffusers.\\n\\nIn hindsight, although I\\'m a prime member and used to getting my items within 1-2 days, this took 10 days to arrive, I presume due to stock being out, but when I ordered, it said in stock. I would have ordered one that included a telephoto lens for shooting my daughter\\'s sports events for an extra $100-150. There are tons of lenses out there and the choices are hard. My next buying plans are to get a telephoto lens like a 70-300 or 55-250 STM and a longer telephoto lens to shoot moon and stars pics. Some of these are in the thousands but lower cost \"ok\" lenses are under $300 so I\\'m going to try that.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a newbie and looking to start with this kit, I\\'d recommend a few things to you:\\n1) look for a good external flash, the one that comes with this is very basic and doesn\\'t work well\\n2) Get a good tripod, the tripod that comes with this kit is junk.\\n3) Stop using Auto Mode. Instead, take a youtube photography course. Chris Bray is one of the pros (uses Canon equipment) and does a good one in 10 parts (all about 15-20 minutes long each) or a longer single marathon one. After each section (10 total), I went outside and took some GREAT pics. My wife\\'s okra plant was blooming and I got a great pro-quality pic in my second day of owning this T7. I have not been happier. I\\'m not getting any benefit mentioning his course, there are other good ones, but his teaching was easy for me to understand and it helped me get up to speed quickly. I\\'m no longer afraid of exposure, ISO, or aperture settings, or shutter speeds. He also has good tips on how to get photos in low-light and recommended setups. I\\'m sure others do the same thing.\\n4) Get a good bag/pack for storing your accessories, you\\'re going to need it down the road.\\nmade.\\n5) Register the camera at Canon, and download the software (both free), and get the PDF manuals. They are a long read, but a good follow up after watching the youtube video courses above.\\n6) Get a data cable. Moving the card over is good enough, but if you are going to update the firmware or use the software to control the camera, you will need to get a Canon data cable.\\n7) The neck strap was ok, but I\\'d prefer a good hand strap that mounts on the side. Altura makes a good one, I see pros using it and after I mounted one (about $25) I will never go back to using a touristy neck strap.\\n8) The stock eye cup for the viewfinder (yes the real way you take photos-stop using the screen unless you need it for specific purposes), wasn\\'t great. I found some on Amazon for less than $10 and they are much better at sealing out the light and making it easier to see the image in the viewfinder. It\\'s easy to slide up and out of the way, and slide in a new one.\\n\\nBottom line, to get started, I\\'d still recommend someone buy a kit like this, just be aware you will need to get some quality items that counter some of the items that come in here. To get started, it\\'s a good basic kit, this gets you going, I just wished the tripod and some other accessories weren\\'t so cheaply made.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I am a believer of reviewing things I buy here on Amazon for others to read, because I use the same research from verified buyers, this is the longest review I\\'ve written to date, I hope it is helpful for you.\\nRead more',\n",

When I tried to order another one of the same generation I've been using, I found it out of stock on Amazon so decided to try the newer 9015. Big mistake. It's been a disaster from the beginning.

       " \"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n I was honestly a bit doubtful of how the HP OfficeJet Pro 9025 all-in-one was going to stack up to the LaserJet I've been using for the last few years. The price point is surprisingly affordable in a field of many printers that claim to offer huge quality at a reasonable price. When I received the printer I was immediately worried that it was going to be way too big to fit into my designated printer space in my home office. Upon opening, I was pleasantly surprised at the set up and how compact it really is for such an extensive machine. Upon unboxing, I followed the set up guide and it was a breeze. Anyone with basic knowledge of a computer could have this set up and put to work in 20 minutes. The bulk of my printing falls into 2 categories- school work and crafting. For school work, a simple color printer gets the job done for producing nice documents and occasional image printing. For crafting, I need a higher quality image, accurate CMYK/color matching, and a high dpi for crisp output. I also require that it can handle sublimation ink for my heat transfer crafts. Well, folks, I am here to tell you that the OfficeJet Pro 9025 delivers all of that and more. After a quick set up and connecting to my computer wirelessly, I did a couple of test prints (see pictures). The color match was spot on. The images were crisp and clear, giving me a photo that was frame-worthy. I would feel as confident printing my personal pictures and crafting images as I would mass printing professional looking flyers for work. I also need to not that the printer is not loud. That's a small peeve, but something that will make me write off a printer. I dont want to hear the screeches or beeps, feel my desk shake as it prints, etc. This printer is quiet, fast, and really performs. Another plus is that it is InstantInk ready. Who hasn't gone to print and realized their cartridge is at the end of its lifespan?! This printer will communicate with InstantInk and based on your chosen subscription, will order your refills as needed! Don't forget that aside from printing, this is a scanner, copier, and fax. It maintains image integrity and produces a fantastic duplication of your documents via copy and scan. There isn't really an area of expertise that this printer doesn't hit the ball out of the park. This is a solid 10/10, highly recommend. It is a behemoth worthy of business use that is just as great for home office use. The price is on point and the quality far exceeds expectations! \\nRead more\",\n",

It has two trays that together can hold an entire ream of paper.\\n\\nIt has a digital screen panel control that help accomplish tasks anywhere from the initial set up to scanning, printing and making cool brochures.\\n\\nYou can connect via wifi using your router network, a connection to the computer with its own direct connection, USb or bluetooth.\\n\\nI have it connected to my wifi router. And , as was true with my other HP wireless printer, this caused some small issues with maintaining connectivity. It might just be the way my ISP and router is set, but I had to go in an give the printer a static IP address because some of the devices in my house (we have 4 computers, 4 phones and a tablet) had trouble discovering the printer based on the home network name, but easily found it based on the IP address. If the IP address changed (which they do in this case because of the way DHCP leases are set up in my home router) then those devices sometimes thought the printer was not online.\\n\\nIt is fast, the print is crisp and clean and I love using the app to print documents from anywhere.\\n\\nOne other thing to mention, the initial set up takes you through a lot of the HP marketing stuff which can be declined. One that seems really attractive is the Instant Ink program. This is a great option, initally, as you can get ink replacement at a deep discount. You set up your account through HP, set up how much ink you think you'll use in a month (this can be adjusted later if you find you use less or more), this will be used to set a recurring, monthly charge from your credit card/bank account. HP can tell when you are getting low on ink and will automatically send you ink before you run out. As mentioned this is offered at a pretty nice discount over buying replacement cartridges in a store. It is a great option if you plan on using and keeping this printer for any length of time. One caveat, if you replace the printer or cancel your instant ink enrollment, the instant ink cartridges will no longer work in your printer as of your effective cancel date. Even if they are already installed in the printer, even if you have some stock piled ready to be installed, yes even the ones already paid for. So for this printer, I declined the instant ink enrollment, since even with the discount I lost money from the last printer I had.

I think all Epson printers have the same issue.\\n\\nSecond, Ink tank quickly drains than you expected. even while it\\'s cleaning ink head you can see the ink gauge is decreasing quite rapidly. So, you should keep an extra replacement ink bottle. however you could see the ink bottle is all sold out from amazon. now you know why.\\n\\nThird. Paper is top loading. this printer is quite compact. width is just a little longer than 11\" letter size paper. (14.8\") but you see the depth is 22.8\" which is longer than the width. because this is the top loading printer, you will need way more space than what it says(I mean more than 22.8\"). otherwise you will easily have some paper jam.\\n\\nAh one more thing.

The paper capacity is really small, for plain copy paper no more than 30 sheets. And here's how you load the paper. Flip open the narrow feeder guard from the rear of the top of the machine. Then slide the edges out. Take a look at the 5th product photo to see what it looks like with the feeder guard out.\\n\\nIf you're a glutton for bad news, hear this. The stated printing speed for color is 5 ppm, and for black is 10.5 ppm. This isn't the best all-in-one for those with 100 page print jobs, in my opinion. Now let's offset this with good news.\\n\\n* You get started with lots of ink. For the average home, it'll be a long time before ordering more ink.\\n* The ink is easy and safe to load. And it feels wonderful to be cartridge-free.\\n* Print quality is excellent to say the least, with highly legible text that's appropriate for most businesses and personal use. Also, its color photo quality printing is superior to laser jet printers at anything like the same cost.\\n* Long-term cost is widely variable depending on many factors such as humidity, and it's far superior to any printer that uses cartridges.\\n* The control panel is intuitive whether one controls the device there or on a phone or computer, and easy to use, in my view.\\n* This printer is well-documented with a 220-page user manual that's available as PDF online. This user manual is written in correct and plain language, demonstrating quality editing that's expected from Epson or any of its peers.\\n* Originated (whatever that really means) in Philippines.\\n\\nI believe this color all-in-one printer is a very good choice for a home printer that everybody at home can learn to use. Epson concentrates its strength and targets this market segment, those who want a reservoir, or supertank, printer for a couple hundred dollars. It certainly beats any cartridge printer, in my opinion. It certainly beats printer models that use subscription services for ink cartridges, which I consider to be a bad deal for subscribers.\\n\\nIt's better to go with a reservoir (aka, supertank) printer for economics and because they're greener than using cartridges.

Considering it uses rollers to feed the document I’d exercise caution with brittle or fragile paper like old family photos.\\n\\nPrint speed is about “average”. Color on regular settings on plain paper will take about 10-20 seconds and black and white about half of those times. Regular black and white text documents will print quickly. Higher quality photo settings with color are the slowest. Id recommend a better printer if you're looking for faster and frequent photo printing.\\n\\nThe ink cartridges are small so this is definitely not a high capacity printer. As i stated earlier, if you infrequently print from time to time this will be sufficient. If you’re really worried about needing more ink HP sells high capacity cartridges.\\n\\nThe wireless has worked flawlessly and was easy to set up. Ive found printing directly from my iPhone is SLOW. One standard print, even in black and white took almost 3 minutes. I usually never print from my phone but it’s nice to have the option.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'Bought the printer a few days ago. Please read on, you will be glad you did, hopefully.\\n\\nWent from an HP OfficeJet 5740 all-in-one that was five years old, and this 8035e all-in-one bests that one by a decent margin in every category. Had to laugh at a couple of comments here, as one guy complained about how much the cartridges cost as he obviously turned down the one year\\'s free ink from HP\\'s Instant Ink included with the 8035e and bought his ink at retail. (I was also skeptical of his post since the 8035e comes with a full set of cartridges--which he didn\\'t mention.) With our 5740 we\\'d been on the Instant Ink program for 3-4 years now--the 100 pages for $4.99 a month with up to 300 roll-over pages you accumulate when you use less than your 100-pages per month allotment (only $60 a year.)\\n\\nJust plug the printer into your home computer network switcher that also connects to the Internet--I don\\'t bother with wireless as I much prefer wired as it is both more reliable and secure as it is immune to interference and much faster, too (when you plug into the printer\\'s Ethernet jack the printer\\'s wireless mode is automatically turned off)--and the Instant Ink program at HP reads your printer and measures your ink supply and actually sends out your replacement cartridges *before you run out of ink*. HP says the Instant Ink program saves ~50% over the cost of retail cartridges and I can easily believe it as I bought retail Ink cartridges for a year before I wised up and moved to HP Instant Ink for the next 3-4 years. Great thing is if you don\\'t want to keep the program HP will cancel it for you at any time without penalty--which is what happened when I pulled the 5740 off of Instant Ink and put the 8035e on in its place.\\n\\nI\\'ve used Inkjets since 1986--lots of different brands--and nothing I\\'ve ever seen beats this Instant Ink deal! Nothing even comes close--used to spend a lot more money on ink than I do now. If you take advantage of the program you can save enough to pay for your printer over time, easily. With the 8035e it\\'s really a no-brainer, because HP gives you 12 full months free! So if you don\\'t believe me, you really need to try the program. It\\'s really liberating not to have to worry about buying print cartridges at retail somewhere! Additionally, with the 5740 HP sent only their XL (extra-large) cartridges! I don\\'t know about the 8035e, as to whether that one will also use XL cartridges, but I\\'m using the cartridges that came with the printer and Instant Ink has already sent me my first replacements--which I will use when these run dry. Should be getting them any day now.\\n\\nOne last thing about Instant Ink--the page count--doesn\\'t matter to HP whether you print 100 full-color pages per month (or more with roll-over) or 100 pages of text! Or any mixture thereof. And color printing full pages uses up a ton of ink very quickly! That\\'s why I love the Instant Ink program.\\n\\nI also simply didn\\'t understand the lady who said the 8035e was \"too expensive.\" I\\'m sorry, ma\\'am, but $199 for an all-in-one that prints, scans, copies and faxes, comes with a year\\'s supply of free ink, too, and a 2-year factory warranty, is simply not \"too expensive\" in my book. The poor woman sounded like she would have been better off with a $40 color printer, unfortunately. And she said it was too complex to operate? Doesn\\'t get any easier than with HP Smart, which is the only printer control software I use and it is so simple to operate, in my opinion. So I can\\'t agree with that assessment anyway. Last, she said it was \"huge,\" I believe. Interestingly enough the printer fits in exactly the same shelf space as my old Officejet 5740 fit into.\\n\\nAnyway--that\\'s my assessment of this printer for what it\\'s worth. (And no, this is not a paid review and I do not work for HP--I\\'m a retired computer gal, actually.) I hope this information helps.\\nRead more',\n",
       " \"Sure, it prints good copy, but so does a far cheaper Brothers. EVERYTHING else about it sucks. It's poorly documented; the tech support is at best mediocre. It's awkward in its construction, resulting in wasted hours of frustration getting it to perform correctly: I've had it for 4 months and have only been able to correctly print envelopes in a manner that leaves the address/return address straight and in the right place once. The paper drawer is flimsy and difficult to replace correctly. And ink refills cost a king's ransom, FAR more expensive than other makers ($85 for a black/red-yellow-blue set). I'll never buy another HP printer.\",\n",
       " \"This was an emergency buy during the height of the pandemic, so my first complaint is that is was super expensive. It will not print if you need a Windows update, at all. So you have to stop what you were in the process of doing, download then restart, so freaking annoying. It's slow, and loud. The instant ink is a joke -- I'm not paying by the page, that's why I bought a printer, whose bright idea was that, way to milk it HP. There are no 3rd market cartridges yet, so ink is expensive.\\n\\nIt is huge, don't rest your paperwork on top of the scanner as it will make annoying noises until you remove them. Not pleased with the scanning software at all. Overall it feels as though it will break soon as most of the components seem to be made of cheap plastic. The print quality is okay, but not amazing for all the hoops you have to jump through just to print a page. Imagine having to do a quick print, then spending 30 minutes wondering why your printer won't work again at least once a week. It's maddening.\\n\\nI will never purchase another HP product, that's how much I hate this printer, they are on the list.\",\n",

       " 'This review is for the Canon TR8620.\\n\\nRunning away from bad experiences with HP printers and that company\\'s anti-consumer practices (i.e. programming their printers with kill switches, rejecting generic inks, and suspicious subscription services) gave me enough motivation to search for better or less evil alternatives. I bought this Canon printer with some reservation but so far my experience has been very positive.\\n\\nThe printing quality when using the TR8620 at default settings looks pretty good. Black text printing looks sharp and the black color looks, well, black. Not reddish black or watered down black but true black (as you would expect). Color printing is also pretty good with some slight grainy-ness at default settings (using plain paper though).\\n\\nI like that the printer asked for permission to \"call home\". I\\'ve grown wary of printers reporting to their makers. If you want to be able to print with your cellphone you must give the printer permission to access the Internet and Canon\\'s related online communication services for the feature.\\n\\nI like that (so far) I can use 3rd party ink without the printer refusing to operate. Being able to choose what kind of ink to use, whether it is official or not, is important to me. I don\\'t know what counter measures Canon has put in place on the printer (if any) but being able to choose promotes a lot of goodwill.\\n\\nI like the touch panel\\'s size. It\\'s big enough to see and operate. The \"Scan to PC\" feature just works. I can begin scanning from the printer without having to do anything on the laptop. The printer guesses what format to use (PDF or JPG) when scanning documents or photos. Saves me the trouble of having to convert formats after scanning. If using the document feeder on top while scanning then the printer will automatically merge the scans into one PDF for you. All of this can be manually overridden should you need to.\\n\\nAs much as I liked the auto document feeder (ADF) attachment I did run into some trouble. One time after an hour or so of use the printer began complaining the ADF was jammed even though there was no paper jam. The computer also started giving \"cannot communicate to scanner\" error messages. After searching the Internet I found a support page at Canon\\'s website that said the ADF was susceptible to heat and high humidity. Although I can still use the flatbed side of the printer when this quirk happens, I was a little bummed out. Months later I learned (after trial and error) the printer sometimes has trouble re-connecting to the monitoring tool on my laptop after long periods of inactivity. Restarting one or both devices usually fixes it for me.\\n\\nAs other reviewers have said the plastic parts that make up the printer\\'s many trays feel kind of flimsy. It gives the impression that it could break easily. On the other hand the trays can be quickly tucked away when not in use.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning the printer\\'s initial setup requires an Internet connection. Canon designed the install process as a website that takes you through a series of short presentations. You can choose to see pictures or watch \"how to\" videos as you go through the motions. You can\\'t just jump to the \"Download Drivers\" section and be done with it. Truth to be told I felt impatient and just wanted to skip it all but I still found it helpful. I later learned there is a download link at Canon\\'s website but you have to search for it on your own.\\n\\nConfiguring Wi-Fi settings was automatic. At some point the installation program uses your laptop\\'s own Wi-Fi to connect directly to the printer and transfer your PC\\'s network settings to it. After this is completed the install program switches back your home network and you are done. It took me about 20-30 minutes to set it all up. Once the printer was on the network, adding it to other family member\\'s laptops was a piece of cake. Using Windows 10 own settings application all I had to do was click on the \"Add a printer or scanner\". Windows automatically found the printer and installed the necessary software.\\n\\nOther than the quirks regarding the ADF and plastic tray I am very pleased with this purchase. It does everything I need and it meets my expectations. Here\\'s hoping the printer will last for many years to come.\\nRead more',\n",

Also has a 2\" cover on the main paper tray that just sits on top of the tray apparently to block things from failing into it since it is under the exit paper tray. Seems like it could have been designed better.\\n2) With the instructions you receive in the box, there is nothing to tell you how to setup WIFI because WIFI is disabled when the printer comes. So the instructions you receive say to hook the printer up with an ethernet cable or printer cable (not included).

       " 'I had no luck trying to connect wirelessly to my Win10 desktop through the Canon online installation process (ij.start.canon). But after downloading the “Canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY” app on my iPhone, I was able to install the printer quickly. Once recognized on my network, all my portable devices as well as the Win10 desktop were able to find the printer. Some notes: Leaving the printer in the “auto power” state will save ink. Duplex copy is not automatic; you need to manually flip & reinsert the original. Two-sided printing is automatic. The plastic doc feeder feels flimsy. Photo quality is very good; document printing is not quite as good as my old Canon IP3600. Wireless printing from all devices is reasonably fast and seamless. Scanner functions are pretty basic (compared to my Epson Perfection V600) but get the job done. The need to leave the front door up seems like a weird design decision. All in all, this printer will work for me.\\n\\nUPDATE: I’m still going to go with a 3-star rating but could bump it to 3 1/2 based on current usage. Once installed, the printer is quite stable and, despite my previous comment, the text printing is better than my old IP3600.

       " \"I saw that another purchaser had the issue with one of the screens having a yellowish tint. I have color calibrated both monitors with a Spyder 4 Pro. You cannot fix the tint issue by color profiling or adjusting settings. It has to do with the LEDs that were used. Subpar in my opinion as whiter LEDs are more expensive to manufacture.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n-They are light weight and have USB hubs built in.\\n-Come with ample connection ports for all types of cable and cables for daisy changing. No HDMI cables though.\\n-They are thin, clear and crisp.\\n-Practically borderless edges giving you almost seamless side by side viewing.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n-Not uniform in color even when calibrated from the factory and a 3rd party color meter.\\n-Menu/control buttons are hidden on the back with an onscreen display selector (horrible design). If you have to adjust a screen when mounted side by side as my image shows, it's not easy to access or toggle.\\n-Some vignetting around the edges.\\n-Build quality seems to be cheap with very flimsy bezels around the edges that seem to be taped on. Not very secure.\\n-USB hubs are on bottom (my Asus ProArt 24 is on the side).

In fact I ordered another set to compare them. When I hooked them up they had brighter (whiter) LEDs but they were just as far off from each other. The spec sheets showed factors that weren't further apart. In fact one of them had a dead pixel (no good for me). Plus with the serial #'s being on the monitor and boxes, there's no way to just switch out one for the other. You have to do the set. I just decided to keep these and deal with the yellow as much as it pains me.

I went in search of reviews describing how to configure the monitor, but there are few out there. Then I had the idea to search for reviews of the 27\" version of this monitor, which led me to this insight: Uniformity is on by default in sRGB and leaving it on drops your contrast in half and disable brightness adjustment!

I haven't had a single problem and Ive had it for almost a year now, an I've been using it with 2 different computers. It's very fast, the color is ridiculously vibrant, it's very clear and sharp. And this monitor actually looks very nice. It's ultra thin, and has a very nice and sturdy stand. In my opinion, monitors with big, bulky stands just stick out like a sore thumb. For all you gamers, if you're budget is tight, this monitor still works well. I used it for gaming for a while and while it was crystal clear, this monitor is only 60hz, so it wasn't as fast as I had hoped. If you have a higher budget, I'd advise looking elsewhere. Anyone who is into editing, designing or any other computer related job, I would totally recommend this display. I'm an editor, and I use premiere. Anyone who uses premiere would know that there are like 4 different work spaces on the screen itself. This monitor displays them all perfectly. Also, it's almost completely borderless. Watching YouTube videos on it, for example, is great because it fills up the entire screen. Who wouldn't want that? Like I said before, if you're looking for a great monitor, but have a low budget, you should stop searching, because you have just found it.\",\n",

       " 'This HP 24mh monitor has a clear, crisp display and is the perfect size for desktop use (not too big, not too small). It accepts both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs (and even VGA for old school PCs). While Windows will select 60Hz refresh rate by default, you can go into Windows\\' display settings and select 75Hz refresh rate for this monitor. The 75Hz refresh rate really does help smooth out motion. You should also go into the monitor\\'s \"Image\" menu setting and set Response Time to Level 3 which provides the best VSYNC performance. One of the best features that places this monitor above and beyond its price range is the 90-degree rotating screen, height adjustment, and swiveling base. The stand is rock-solid without any wobble. The speakers are just fine once you discover the menu control I explain below:\\n\\nHOW TO FIX LOW VOLUME SOUND: The built-in speakers are better than some reviewers indicate. I believe most people don\\'t discover that the monitor menu has its own volume control that\\'s set to 50% volume by factory default. If you just connect this monitor to the PC you\\'ll automatically get sound through the HP speakers via HDMI or DisplayPort (you only have to use the separate audio cable when using the VGA input). But no matter how high you turn up your PC volume control, you\\'ll only get 50% volume from the monitor\\'s speakers which is why people complain about low volume. To fix this, all you need to do is go to the \"Management\" tab of the monitor menu, select \"Audio\", and then turn up the volume control from 50 (default) to 100 and you\\'ll find the monitor speakers are plenty loud. After that, you\\'ll only have to use your PC volume control as normal.\\n\\nThis is a great quality monitor with features beyond its price range. Fantastic value, HP!\\n\\nADDITIONAL NOTE: HP sells an identical monitor to the HP 24mh under the model P24h. The only difference is that the P24h has a black plastic logo strip along the bottom instead of silver like the 24mh. Everything else is identical (specs, speakers, height adjustable stand, etc.) plus the P24h comes with both an HDMI cable and a DisplayPort cable.\\nRead more',\n",

       " 'Very impressed with this product. There are a lot of dual monitor desk arms available on Amazon. What I wanted was one that wasn\\'t gas spring. This one appears to be spring loaded and it works great. It\\'s very adjustable. I had a specific need for a dual monitor setup. I have two 27\" monitors with one horizontal and the other vertical and I wanted the horizontal one (the primary monitor) to be centered on my desk with the vertical one to the side. I was a bit concerned about whether this arm would be strong enough to hold both (they both weigh about 17lbs). I was also a bit concerned about whether I could position the monitors exactly where I wanted them. My desk bumps up about 1\" from the back wall, so that was a concern as well. But after assembling everything and spending some time adjusting I got everything exactly where I want it and it\\'s fantastic. Removing the monitor stands off my desk frees up a bunch of room and add a nice de-clutter look to my desk.\\nAssembly was fairly straightforward. The instructions are pretty basic, but it\\'s easy to figure everything out. The base that attaches to the desk is very sturdy and clamps down securely (my desk is about .8\" thick). Adding the 2 arms is a breeze, and one thing I really liked about the assembly you attach the Vesa mount plates to the back of the monitors independently of the arms and then slide and lock them into the end of the arms. There is a bit of wiggle between the end of the arm and the base plate attachment, but once the monitors are positioned in place it causes no issues.\\nThe tension in the arms is very easy to adjust with the included wrench. I simply relieved some of the tension on both arms, got the monitors exactly where I wanted them, then tightened the tension and now they stay put with zero sag. There is outstanding range of motion for positioning the monitors where I needed them.\\nOverall extremely happy with this purchase and glad I chose this product.\\nRead more',\n",

       " \"If I were to review the mount on its own, I'd give it a 5. It is sturdy, holds my 32 inch monitor, and does what it is supposed to so far. It has a pretty decent range of motion and is positioned exactly where I wanted it. I like that you can clamp this stand to a desk or even drill a hole and affix it that way using the included tools. It is slightly on the bulkier side compared to other mounts that I've seen, but it does feel very sturdy, and that's something you want when you're holding up a big monitor.\\n\\nIf you do use the clamp setup like I did, keep in mind you'll need at least 3 inches or so of actual desk length. I mention this because many desks have metal bars underneath them which might prevent you from mounting it directly to the desk depending on where they are.\\n\\nThe mount is decently easy to set up, but there are many included parts that you may find yourself left over with as I did. This is because the instructions are very minimal. You'll have to watch a few online videos to make sure that you've done everything correctly. Seems like it'd be very simple to include some updated and more detailed instructions!\",\n",

This monitor arm also allowed me to adjust the height of the monitor to my height. I made it so that I have to sit up straight, which is great for my lower back!\\n\\nInstructions are vague so just watch the installation video. The clamp is solid and attaches firmly to my desk. Nice finish. The cable organizer also keeps the cords away and everything looking neat. The setup is very intuitive and simple. I wish I purchased it sooner!',\n",
       " \"This monitor is definitely a good value. Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.\\n\\nAll in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"I've seen many other reviews saying this monitor does not tilt, but it in fact does.

The headphone jack is garbage but fortunately, it\\'s not a deal-breaker because the monitor sound is good. It\\'s really only 18\" and they may leave it at your door in the product box so all your neighbors and passerbys can see you bought a monitor. Read full review for details.\\n\\nSo I\\'ve been shopping around for a couple of weeks now trying to put together a decent little gaming computer and when I finally got around to shopping for the monitor... here\\'s this lovely monitor for only $88.... can\\'t be right. I click and read through the specs....this can\\'t be right. Then I look through the reviews... about 300/4000 (4/11/2020) reviews were 1 stars with sound issues, screen issues, power cord issues, one-and-done then never coming back on, and just plain crappy craftsmanship.\\n\\nThat being said... the numbers.... 300/4000 are what convinced me to at least give it a try... I mean for $88 bucks and with amazon return/refund policy the worst that would happen is that I get a dud and I just don\\'t repurchase the monitor and I find a better one. So I ordered it.\\n\\nPROS(ish)\\n\\nI received it today.. plugged it in... and held my breath as pressed the power button. IT LIVES! There\\'s one big complaint/ 1-star rating worry crushed.\\n\\nI hook it up to my laptop... I jump over to Youtube to test the sound... IT SINGS! Another hurdle/ 1-star rating worry crushed.\\n\\nI then unplug everything and properly set it up ( I didn\\'t set up the stand or other bits because I didn\\'t want to have to re-wrap and pack if I got a dud)... I set up the stand and place it on my desk with my other things and plug it up again... IT COMES BACK TO LIFE!\\n\\nI put in my copy of Avatar to test the 1080p they boast about for the monitor and IT LOOKS GORGEOUS!\\n\\nCONS\\n\\nSo now most of my biggest 1-star worries are crushed however there are 3 non-deal-breakers that I have with the monitor.\\n\\nIt has an audio jack for headphones but the sound is so grainy and there\\'s a lot of noise. I tried several different headphones and they all sound like garbage unless you turn it down to lower volume where you can\\'t hear the noise. SO while the sound from the monitor is great the sound for headphones is garbage.\\n\\nNext, 20\" they say? I don\\'t want to make a \"boys can measure joke\" but... it\\'s really only 18\"... so if you\\'re really looking for those extra 2\" they aren\\'t there.\\n\\nLastly, is a shipping issue... the box they ship it in is the product box, like fresh off the shelf at a store. Guys, you\\'re sending this to someones house/apartment?! Thankfully I was home when it was delivered and I got an email from Amazon letting me know my delivery was close by BUT what is I hadn\\'t been home?

I hadn\\'t heard of Sceptre, but the reviews were positive, so I ordered one. It arrived in two days, well packaged and padded. I was impressed that a screwdriver and two different connector cables were included with the purchase. Assembly was easy and intuitive. Plugged it in and connected to my computer and it booted right up. I\\'ve used it for one day and have been quite pleased. I imagine if it was side by side with a gaming display I might notice some quality disparities, but for my purposes this works extremely well.

       " 'I have a 4K monitor at home and use a 2K monitor at work. I ordered this monitor from Dell for my wife to use with her laptop at home. While (as expected) the quality of the display is not 4K standard, I was nonetheless impressed with how clear and sharp the screen image was once I connected it and fired it up.\\n\\nAs is reflected in its price, this is a fairly basic, no-frills monitor. The only connections (other than the power cord connection), as shown in the description photo, are HDMI and VGA. It has no built-in speakers.\\n\\nIt came with a VGA cable but not an HDMI cable, which surprised me but didn’t bother me because I already have more on hand than I will ever need.\\n\\nThe monitor’s height does not adjust up and down, but the screen itself does tilt up and down.\\n\\nIt is very light weight-wise and the base does take up very little real estate, which is a plus. I do like the thin bezel because it means no wasted space on the monitor.\\n\\nSetting it up was quick and simple. The post attaches to the base with a built-in screw that you tighten by hand, the other end of the post snaps into the back of the monitor while it’s still in the box, and then you simply remove it from the box and connect the cables. Be aware that the mount is not VESA standard, it’s a unique design.\\n\\nIt came well packaged (a box in a box) and in good condition.\\n\\nI am giving it five stars because it is exactly what I thought it would be: a basic monitor with HD resolution. The quality of the screen is surprisingly sharp and meets my needs perfectly, and all I needed was an HDMI connection.

       " 'Frankly, not much of a review of the screen itself because it\\'s perfect. Might as well be a photograph. I do note the viewing angle is so wide that it has no color or picture shifting even when you look at it totally from the side edge on. I do stream video sometime on it (Amazon Prime Video, NetFlix, etc.) and I might as well be watching a TV. I Don\\'t use it for gaming (I don\\'t do shot \\'em ups or GTA stuff) so can\\'t comment about that. Specs look good, but gamers are super hard core about bleeding, ghosting, etc. so no opinion there. I will say that blacks are very black, which is good, not the funky dark brown/green/blotchy/yuk stuff.\\n\\nI had a SE2717H (prior model of this one) that died after being on 24/7 for over two years. My other SE2717H is going strong and right next to this one. Picture is awesome, I love the IPS screen and I can work all day on it with no eye strain. IPS is all I buy anymore for myself or recommend to others. There are slightly better technologies out there now, but not for the money, especially MY money.\\n\\nScreen height is the same as the prior model so they go next to each other just fine. It is not adjustable up and down, only tilts front to back so it needs to be matched in hit to, not adjusted to match another monitor. There are no VESA mounting holes on the back so it must sit on the desk. The bezel is paper thin on this one (about 1/2\" on the SE2717) but appears to be just under 1/4\" due to the black edge on the panel itself. For $139.99 with next day delivery, you can\\'t go wrong. Slight difference in the two is one is hooked up VGA and the other hooked up HDMI as they are the outputs on my PC. When I swapped the cables, the slight difference moved as well.

       " \"I've had this projector for a couple days now and it has blown me away. I upgraded from an old optima hd20 because I wanted 4k hdr and this LG projector delivers both. As long as this projector gets the rated 30k hours usage, i'll be completely satisfied.\\n\\nSetup was quick enough, I used an existing ceiling mount from my old projector. When I first turned HU70LA on, it recognized it was upside down and flipped the image automatically, that was a nice touch. I'm projecting from about 15ft away onto a 133in screen and the image is plenty bright, even with some ambient light in the room things are still watchable. Something really noticeable, especially in HDR content is how vivid everything looks. The colors are really vibrant. The throw distance i'm using is about as far away from my screen as i can while not making the image too large for my screen. If you have a longer throw distance you are going to need a bigger screen. I did have to use the keystone alignment, it only adjusts vertically and not horizontally (but i only needed vertical keystone).\\n\\nLG's webOS is integrated just like their TV's. The magic remote is just that. Magic. I really like the motion control cursor and the smart features of the projector. I didn't think i would use them a lot, but it is just really convenient rather than turning on my xbox or apple tv. It is also really easy to have different image presets and swap between them (for example a gaming preset and then a movie preset) CEC works to turn on my receiver so with the one remote it is all I need if i'm streaming things from webOS. If you have used webOS on any of their recent tvs, no surprises here. its the same great experience.\\n\\nNormally i don't like the smooth motion image interpolation when watching tv or movies, but on a projector and screen this large i've become a quick fan. Everything about it just feels better. (Not for gaming though, only for video content consumption)\\n\\nBeing able to play pc games at 1080p and 120hz is pretty amazing. One of the reason i selected this model was for pc gaming on a big screen and not having to sacrifice high refresh rate is absolutely awesome. The input lag on game mode (while i'm not sure what it is) was not noticeable to me.\\n\\nMy only image complaint is the black levels aren't super great. They are decent, but when you go watch something darker like Batman the dark knight or Mr Robot, i found I had to turn up the brightness setting on the projector to actually see details in the dark. Doing this washes out the image a little bit, but it still is a great improvement over my old projector. I just made a preset for darker things and switch to it when needed.\\n\\nIt would also be nice if the power supply was internal so it used a normal plug to the projector from the wall rather than using a power brick, but i feel like that is really nitpicky. In my situation i just zip tied it to my ceiling projector mount arm and called it good. It isn't as clean as an install though as just plugging a cable directly from the outlet into the projector.\\n\\nAlso wanted to make a quick note, make sure that you get cables rated for 4k@60hz (18Gbps). I first tried with an old high speed cable that was only rated for 4k@24hz (10.2Gbps) and I couldn't push 4k content to the projector. Just keep cabling in mind when getting a projector like this.\\n\\nEDIT: After using this projector for a little over a month I tried to get the Disney+ app on it but it is not supported. This projector is running webos 3 instead of 4 (you need 4 for the more recent channels like disney+). My LG TV bought in 2017 has been updated with webos 4 and can get Disney+ so i'm hoping that LG updates the projector as well at some point.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'Originally I rated this a 3 star projector. But, the execution here is truly phenomenal. The complete package comes in at one extra star. And, I\\'ve updated my prior review. After even more testing I found that the black levels are... acceptable. It has good traits. It has bad traits. The good do outweigh the bad.\\n\\nIn short: if you intend to replace a TV with this projector, then by all means pick it up. I was sporting a 10ft screen (120\" diagonal) and at first glance, with some ambient light, I was very impressed. The color is truly excellent, as others have noted. It is so excellent it shines in bright ambient light, catching the eye and filling in the image. The color is what makes this LED projector shine (pun intended). It is lovely.\\n\\nThe problems begin when you lower the lights for a bit more clarity because... well, there isn\\'t any. The exact same image you saw with ambient light? That\\'s nearly what you are getting when the lights are low. There isn\\'t any extra dark hiding in the shadows. It\\'s going to be good color and only acceptable dark forever.\\n\\nIn its favor this projector sports 30,000 hours of lamp life. This is near-TV levels of lifespan for the light source, normally the trouble area for projectors. It touts being rainbow-effect free, though I oddly thought I caught some here or there. Did I mention it has magnificent color? It has LG\\'s WebOS built in and can capably stream many, many wonderful apps in full 4k (not Disney+ or Hulu at this time). It is light. It is svelt. It has the back-lit magic remote.\\n\\nBut, it has poor, poor black levels, requiring you to wash out the picture to bring them up in HDR (far better performance in SDR). It has decent, but not great, input lag for gaming (40+ ms for 4k, 50+ ms in SD). It isn\\'t the greatest optically (mine had minor focus uniformity issues). It isn\\'t truly all that bright, despite the incredible color brightness. Strangely, that will affect you more in the dark, it seemed to me, than in the daylight. Also, the brightness is more an issue with the desired size of my screen (120\"). At a smaller size the brightness may be far more tolerable.\\n\\nLike I said, it has good and bad traits.

       " 'NOTE: I give it a 4-star review, but it\\'s actually 3.5/5\\n\\nI have wanted to get a projector since 2004. However, circumstances have kept me from biting the bullet. First, 1080p became a new thing, so projectors were WAY spendy for 1080p. Then, 3d came out. As I waited for those prices to drop, 4k got released. I didn\\'t care much about 4k until HDR came around. THEN, I was interested. Since then, I have been waiting for a price-to-performance window with very specific features. I finally decided to bite the bullet and go for the LG HU80-KA.\\n\\nThe Good Things:\\n1. Portable, great for on-the-go\\nThis projector is extremely light, and I like how everything is contained into a compact rectangle. The cord can be pulled into the projector, and you just lift up the handle and take it wherever you want to go. I plan to bring this with me to beach trips with friends, where we will barbecue and drink while movies are playing.\\n\\n2. Extremely quiet\\nI have this mounted about two feet behind my head. I can\\'t hear it at all, even with low volume audio while watching a movie.\\nI attempted to place it inside a shelf that allowed 4-5 inches of space around the projector. This caused the fans to go into overdrive. It still wasn’t all that loud. It’s comparable to a laptop running at high fan speed (which is essentially what the fans are).\\n\\n3. HD video (blu-ray) looks amazing\\nThis is a real stunner with a good quality blu-ray. I put in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and it was just plain spectacular. A good blu-ray will look really good from this projector.\\n\\n4. HDR color is very nice.\\nI’ll discuss more about my HDR misgivings next, but… I have no issues about the deep, rich color that beautifies UHD video sources. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is a perfect example. It’s like this projector and that movie were MFEO.\\n\\nThe Not-so-good Things:\\n1. HDR tone mapping can be good, or very not-good\\nWhen I first started playing 4k UHD/HDR titles, I was woefully unimpressed. The picture was way too dark, and color was flat and uninspired. But of course, it\\'s important to tweak your stuff. I have an OLED65C7 as well, and I never ever touch the \"Dynamic Contrast\" setting. It\\'s not needed. However, I have read/heard that the 2016 series LG OLED displays do a better job tone mapping the HDR data when \"Dynamic Contrast\" is turned on. I tried it with this projector, and BOOM - instant increase in quality!\\nI no longer thought \"Eh, Vivid Mode might be the best option - and Vivid Mode is something that I have never, ever, EVER preferred or used in all my years of having a display.\" Instead, I thought \"Wow, Cinema mode looks great. Technicolor mode is also nice, with a slightly yellowish golden hue that works for some movies, maybe not for others.\" Depending on the movie, I have a \"cooler\" presentation with Cinema, slightly darker/warmer settings for Cinema (User), and the Technicolor mode looks great for other movies.\\nNOTE: The HDR settings menus is separate from non-HDR video settings.\\nThe real stunner UHD presentations included Hacksaw Ridge; Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2; Spider-Man: Homecoming; and Blue Planet II.\\n\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" looked great during daytime shots, but I noticed heavy macroblocking and bloom during the sandstorm sequence. Flames looked terrible as well, but I don\\'t know if it was as bad, or worse looking, than on my OLED. They just plain look weird in HDR.\\nSo far (I will keep tweaking settings), I noticed that highlights suffer from noise, especially white backgrounds, and gradation jumps out at me on all fronts. I don\\'t like any of those \"noise reduction\" or \"movie optimizer\" or \"frame interpolation smoothiemoothie\" dongles. I am not fond of artifacting.\\nI watched several older movie remasters by Sony, such as Men in Black; Ghostbusters; Spider-man; and Spider-Man 2. I found the color to be slightly drained, when using the same settings used for the newer movies, but Technicolor was more pleasant with these titles. It really depends on what I\\'m watching for which mode I think looks best.\\nFor older movies especially, I found the HDR made highlights too overblown. An example is during Ghostbusters at around the 1hr 10min mark, when the GB team are being greeted by hundreds of bystanders before they head into the final showdown. The street has sunlight gleaming off the tarmac as they are driving in the Ecto-1, and it\\'s blown out and had notable macroblocking.\\n\\n2. Blacks are kind of milky\\nI have an OLED display. It would be unfair as heck to compare a mid-range projector on a white 1.1 gain screen to the blacks available on an OLED. Or the color reproduction. I found darker movies could sometimes make me yearn for the OLED, such as when I watched \"Logan\" (looks good most of the time); \"The Equalizer\" (it looks stable enough, but on the OLED it looks much, much better); or \"Men in Black 3\". Look, I\\'m not saying it\\'s unwatchable. I am just saying that, well... it\\'s not a $6000 Sony projector, nor a similarly-priced JVC or Epson. Also, I am sure costs were cut using the .47 DMD instead of the newer, bigger version. They sacrificed that, I’d wager, for laser projection and a compact design. However, I figure savvy engineering can muster better performance from the same chip that is used by other devices; I compare it to the way DAC chips can be deemed unimpressive, but in the hands of another engineer (think Schiit), it becomes magic.\\n\\nMy room is completely dark, with tan/beige walls.\\nI plan to get a grey fabric screen soon, and that might help push the blacks into a slightly darker realm. For now, it\\'s not \"terrible\". For most people it might not even be bad at all. I just happen to be very spoiled with my displays over the years to notice.\\n\\n3. Placement options are lame\\nThis has a 1.0 to 1.2 zoom capability. I have a 110 inch screen. I want to watch movies from 9-13 feet away. This means that I would have to sit really far behind the projector at the 1.0 distance if it\\'s in front of me. However, if I place the projector BEHIND me, then I need to set it 1-2 feet behind me, and I personally don\\'t have a ceiling mount. I live in an apartment, and I can\\'t drill holes. So, I have to place it on stands behind me to raise the projector. I do not want to use the auto-keystone feature, because 1) it reduces output quality (the more keystone smear, the worse it gets) and 2) it makes the display really, really tricky to tweak.\\n\\n4. No lens shift\\nWith a 1.0 to 1.2 zoom, it means that the projector will most likely be sitting in the middle of the exact spot that you want to be watching movies from.\\nIf you don\\'t mind sitting a couple feet to the right or left, that\\'s probably fine. But for center-brained people like me, it makes placement annoying. I either need to A) place it in front of me, and it obstructs my view, and I\\'m sitting farther back than I prefer; or B) it is directly BEHIND me, and I\\'m sitting at the distance I want... but I have to be far to the right or left of center. Unless it\\'s raised to the height of the TOP of the screen, but as previously mentioned, I can\\'t drill holes in my ceiling.\\nI think a lens shift option would have greatly alleviated this complaint.\\n\\nCONCLUSION (October 10 Update):\\nAfter two months of use, here are my \"final thoughts\".\\nSince this is my first projector purchase, I now have a better idea on what I want when I choose to upgrade in a couple/few years.\\n\\nLessons Learned:\\n\\n- Use a grey screen, or silver grey screen. I\\'m getting one when I buy a home theater projector in a couple/few years. In a completely dark room, it DOES make a difference in blacks and contrast levels!\\n- For \"ultimate video quality\", it doesn\\'t seem like laser bulbs can compete, unless you\\'re willing to dish out a LOT more dough for the technology. Depending on what\\'s available by 2021, I may opt for better video performance/quality instead of the great portability features of the LG HU80KA. Without a doubt, a $2500 regular bulb projector will stomp this $3000 projector in color reproduction and black levels. But, it doesn\\'t mean this model isn\\'t without its strong points!\\n- I still think LG\\'s HDR tone mapping needs some fixing up. I don\\'t know if any firmware update can fix it, or if LG even has the issue on their radar. If the 4k UHD movie has grain (think older movies), then the HDR algorithm goes poopy. I mentioned this already in my review, but I think adding Dynamic Contrast (to allow the HDR to \"pop\" the way it should) along with the projector\\'s method of converting the content causes issues. It\\'s still nice to look at, and I think most people will be less likely to notice. I am kind of a video quality freak. HDR with the LG HU80KA on grain-free movies is stellar!\\n\\nLG HU80KA; THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY:\\nDon\\'t be disappointed by the underpar performance compared to bulb projectors at this price range. There are things to like...\\n- It is light, and portable. I will use this for public gatherings, picnics, and to use while doing podcasts as a digital poster and/or to have motion posters when talking with guests (the mirror flipped up will be helpful for me ONLY in this circumstance haha). This means that I plan to be carrying it to many destinations. I can\\'t think of a projector with 4k (real or fake), HDR, decent light output, good wireless connections options, as well as a lightweight design in such a small package. The laser bulb helps lighten the load, and I like the longevity of the bulb life (as well as more consistent color and brightness performance over time).\\nTHAT is this projector\\'s greatest strength.\\n- If you want to permanently mount this, and will rely on it solely for dark room \"home theater\" use... it\\'s not worth it. I recommend scores of other options for $3000.\\n- If you like to watch broadcast television, live sports, and have low ambient light while friends are sitting around drinking and eating chips and dip... this will work out pretty nicely. ESPECIALLY if (once again) you want to move this thing around a lot! Otherwise, save some money and get a cheaper 1080p projector with 3000+ lumens ;)\\n\\nUPDATE (October 1, 2018) - Trying different screen fabric samples:\\nI purchased the Silver Ticket Products sample kit. There are different fabrics (9\"x11\") allowing the customer to test the differences between each of them. Below are my impressions:\\nGrey - Light Grey: I found that the light grey most definitely increases black levels, while maintaining almost the same amount of brightness. Additionally, I noticed that colors were VERY SLIGHTLY more \"poppy\" and saturated. However, color difference is negligible. Black levels are not; it is certainly an improvement.\\n\\nSilver - Silver Metallic: This fabric provides even deeper blacks, and colors are about the same as I found with the light grey material. I will do more testing soon, but out of all three fabrics, I found this one to be far and away the best option. This seems to sacrifice lumen output/brightness very slightly. However, in a completely dark room I don\\'t think the difference will be so drastic that most viewers would be upset with the change (I would guess it decreases brightness from 1400, down to ~1100 lumens).\\n\\nHigh Contrast - Dark Grey: The dark grey is very sensitive to variations in the flatness of the fabric (easily prone to \"hotspotting\"). I used Scotch tape to tape the back of the fabric. This caused bright spots where the tape was located on the back. With that said, I found the high contrast dark grey to be TOO dark.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the most pleasing visual marriage between the projector and fabric type the Silver Ticket Product\\'s \"Silver Metallic\" finish. However, a \"Light Grey\" finish is most definitely an improvement over my 1.1 gain white screen.\\nHope this helps!\\n\\nThank you for reading my long, LONG review. I hope some of the information contained has been helpful. Take care!\\nRead more',\n",
       " 'The LG HU80KA is one really peculiar projector for numerous reasons, so let\\'s start at the beginning:\\n\\nThe unboxing procedure couldn\\'t be any easier. Open box, grab the projector (by the handle!), pull it out, and plug it in.\\n\\nOK, fine - one more step.. Grab the remote as well, pop the included 2x AA batteries in the battery compartment, and away you go. That\\'s it. There\\'s no other parts or accessories. No lamps to replace, no filters to clean - nothing.\\n\\nSo, for starters, I brought this projector down into my cave. This is a dedicated movie space, with black walls, velvet treatments, and a Stewart StudioTek 100 115\" 16:9 screen. Currently I\\'m using a JVC DLA-RS540 as my main viewing projector, so I was reaaaaaally (and I mean reaaaaaally) interested to see how this new laser projector would stack up, despite being half the price of the JVC.\\n\\nFirst things, first - getting the image shining at my Stewart screen really couldn\\'t be easier when the device is standing upright. See, the LG\\'s pièce de résistance is that you can bring it anywhere, easily. Pick it up by its carry handle, plop it down on the floor, and use the included mirror flap to shine the image at your screen. No need to mount the thing or find a table to lay it on. Apparently there\\'s a 4% decrease in lumen output when using the mirror versus mounting the projector pointing at the screen, but if there is a difference in brightness - I couldn\\'t tell.\\n\\nThen, the power on. The power on procedure on my JVC projector is as follows:\\n\\n1.) Turn on projector with power button.\\n2.) Go get some coffee while it (a lamp-based projector) spends a few minutes warming up/brightening up.\\n\\nWith the LG?\\n\\n1.) Turn on projector with power button.\\n2.) Use projector just about immediately, at full brightness.\\n\\nLasers are awesome. Lasers! PEW-PEW!\\n\\nPicture:\\n\\nBut... lasers have issues. Much like JVC\\'s flagship laser projector, the DLA-RS4500, the LG HU80KA has a contrast deficiency compared to its lamp-based brethren. Don\\'t get me wrong, in no way am I comparing this LG to JVC\\'s big boy, but it\\'s a trait shared between the two - that if you DEMAND the best contrast over anything else, then lamp-based projectors are still where you should head.\\n\\nThe LG has three brightness settings - found under Energy Savings. The LG HU80KA\\'s blacks take on a grey-ish, milky look, that in my dedicated movie space are less than impressive, and that’s putting it mildly. Even with the energy savings set the highest level to decrease lumen output, I could never get the black levels where I wanted them to be. And with no dynamic iris of any sort, the LG just can\\'t cut it for absolute contrast. It’s worse than my old Sony VPL-HW50ES 1080p projector. Again, this is NOT a cave-movie-room projector at all.\\n\\nColor, though? Sharpness, though? Both are really, really excellent on the LG. Really punchy colors from this DLP setup, and - much like JVC\\'s setup (bar their laser model), - it also uses a form of pixel-shifting to achieve its 4K resolution. So no, it\\'s not native 4K, and no - I firmly believe this doesn\\'t matter. I used to be a naysayer of pixel-shifting, but for movie/TV-watching, it\\'s incredible. My other viewing environment is my LG C7 4K OLED, so resolution IS important, but pixel-shifters are phenomenal in this regard. That said, I noticed a slight sharpness deficiency in the top right corner of my screen using the LG standing up (with the mirror in use), but direct on the sharpness was excellent throughout. I only noticed on text, anyway, so for regular use it would never be an issue.\\n\\nSo the picture is good, - really good even - except for the middling contrast in a cave. In a living room or any room with a little ambient light, this contrast deficiency likely won\\'t even matter, and the brightness of this projector is really something. 2,500 lumens (uncalibrated, sure - but all manufacturers quote these numbers in this regard). It really packs a punch. In my living room, firing at a white wall at mid-day, the image was still perfectly watchable at minimum Energy Saving setting. At night, the image is TOO bright at this same setting.\\n\\n4K HDR looks fantastic. Planet Earth II on UHD pops, John Wick Chapter 2 is also impressive (raw black levels aside). 24p motion is also well taken care of, with LG’s usual TrueMotion settings allowing tweaking of things further.\\n\\nA quick mention of the DLP technology at play here: I’m usually pretty sensitive to “rainbows” with DLP projection. I won’t say the LG is completely free of the phenomenon, but I never noticed it in actual material, - just on white text when my eyes would flick between words. So, again, for movie/TV watching, - not an issue. Your mileage may vary here, but I’ve struggled with DLP rainbow in the past so I’m confident in saying it shouldn’t be an issue for most.\\n\\nLess impressive is the mirror mechanism. It’s a manual thing that you lift up and down, and once in position for a few seconds the projector will automatically keystone-adjust the image. Keystone adjustment is just… bad, in general. You never want to use it because it does distort the image somewhat - despite not always being obvious in the badness. However, in the case of a mirror design like this, there’s no real choice. The problem then becomes that the projector doesn’t always get its keystone adjustment quite right, so there can be a little distortion in terms of image shape, especially if your image is not projected very large. I found that when blasting an image around 65” diagonal and up that the keystone distortion was kept to a minimum (if not perfect). With the image smaller than that (unlikely for most people), the keystoning was more visible. Also, because the mirror is not electronic, it’s possible to have the image be not quite flat or aligned correctly just because the mirror isn’t sitting quite “right” when you adjust it. So I’ve on occasion had to just wiggle the mirror or move it up and down to the same position for it to sit “right” and look rectangular on the screen. It’s just not completely fool-proof, despite working reasonably well. You can also fully disable the keystone correction, thankfully, if you’re able to get your geometry just right (no easy task).\\n\\nAlong with no mechanical mirror adjustment, there’s also no mechanical zoom/focus adjustment. On the side of the projector there are two dials, one for zoom and one for focus. They’re quite stiff, and need a little finessing, but they do work. Also, when using the mirror the focus does change when adjusting the zoom, so this is something to bear in mind. You will always need to adjust zoom AND focus, even if the focus was perfect at one zoom level.\\n\\nSpeaking of zoom level, it’s a 1.0 - 1.2x zoom mechanism here, so there’s not much flexibility. This is NOT a short-throw projector, so if you want e.g. a 120” diagonal 16:9 image, you’ll need to place the projector a minimum of 11.4 feet away. There’s also absolutely no lens shift of any sort. Sitting the LG on the floor and using the mirror gives you image-up/down flexibility (at the cost of some keystone adjustment), but there’s no lateral shift available. The non-flexibility of placement comes at a cost here, which I’ll touch on more later.\\n\\nNoise levels:\\n\\nThe LG is extremely quiet (brilliantly so) with Maximum Energy Savings turned on, noticeably louder with that set to Medium, and louder still when set to Minimum. Noise is extremely subjective. I would say I’d prefer the unit to be quieter when set to full brightness, but it’s not an especially intrusive fan noise. The thing that may potentially be bothersome to some is the high-pitched sound that emanates from the unit when the laser is enabled (it seems to go away if you close the mirror - which shuts the laser engine off). I’m sensitive to high-pitched sounds, so this sort of thing is a tad bothersome. Whether you notice it will depends on a few factors:\\n\\n1.) How far you sit from the projector.\\n2.) The position you sit in relation to the projector.\\n\\nI found that moving to the left or right of the projector changed that sound dramatically, so your mileage may vary here. Overall, though, with any movie/TV sound playing, I found no real issue with the sound signature from the projector. Projectors just make noise, and that’s the way it is.\\n\\nFrom what I can tell, there are four fans, two on each side of the projector - that blow air in, and then out the other side.\\n\\nOh, and amusingly, when you turn the projector on, it absolutely sounds like there’s a little hard drive spinning up inside. No, I’ve got zero idea about this, either…\\n\\nSmart TV:\\n\\nMuch like my LG C7 OLED, this projector uses WebOS 3.5, which works great, - really smoothly, and with the same remote with mouse-like features that this TV has. I was able to get the projector connected to 5Ghz WiFi without issue, and downloaded YouTube, Netflix, and … wait a second, where’s Amazon Prime video!? I know I have Prime Video on my LG TV, so where is the app on this projector? Nowhere to be found, currently. This is a massive disappointment to me, and very odd. Hopefully LG adds Prime Video back in with a software update because it’s sorely missed. There were no updates available when I checked. Boo.\\n\\nThe YouTube app works just great, although - amusingly, it keeps pestering me to dictate my searches. The LG HU80KA remote has no such microphone functionality, though my LG C7 OLED does. Go figure. 4K HDR YouTube looks pretty great, as you’d imagine.\\n\\nSound:\\n\\nThe LG has stereo speakers inside itself. For a projector the sound is out of this world. But, temper your expectations a little. Despite being in a league of its own in terms of audio output, there’s some clipping of certain frequencies that are bothersome. Keeping the volume lower doesn’t seem to affect how often the audio clips, so it’s frequency dependent, not volume - when it clips. For the most part, though, the sound really is something special. There’s not really any bass to speak off, but it’s remarkable how FULL the sound is from a projector. Who’d have thought?\\n\\nIn my movie space, I paired the projector with my Denon AVR-X4300H receiver over Bluetooth, because in a living-room space this could be a VERY useful feature to avoid cabling. Unfortunately, no matter how much I tried, the audio was out of sync with the video by close to two seconds (!!). Nothing I did would fix this - not in the receiver or the projector. Boo.\\n\\nErgonomics:\\n\\nSo, the carry handle is adorable. I mean really, a carry handle on a projector! Also, the power cord is integrated, - 10 ft long, and retracts into the unit with a press of a button on the left side. Very cool. Interestingly, though, with the USA version I have, the power cord is not grounded. It’s just a regular two-prong. The best thing about this projector is that you just grab it and go. You’ve got your apps, and screen sharing features built in. You’ve got WiFi built in, the power cord built in etc. It’s just a complete package.\\n\\nThe question then remains: Who is this projector for? Well, that’s a tough one. I hate to say it, but it feels like this projector is more for demos and presentations than for actual movie rooms or living rooms - when using it standing up. See, it’s not a short throw (a major downer), which means the projector is likely going to be placed bang smack where people are seated, - which is a nuisance. And let’s be honest here - you’re not likely to use the projector’s built-in speakers long-term, no matter how good they are. If you’re spending this kind of money on a projector, you likely are going to have at least a sound bar or separate speakers to get the most out of your setup. So then you’re talking cabling etc. And that complicates the whole setup. And if you’re in a dedicated movie-space cave, then the contrast of this projector is plain and simply not even close to good enough.\\n\\nSo, it’s a bit of a pain in the living room, and doesn’t do a good enough job in a dedicated movie space. That leaves classrooms and business demos. Sure, it has a handle, but it also weighs about 15lbs, and has no case of any sort (not even a sleeve protect it just a little).\\n\\nI just don’t know. While this is an interesting and unique projector in this space - I feel like it’s a solution looking for a problem, in at least a few ways. Fundamentally, if this were an ultra-short throw projector, it would open up so many brilliant placement options. But since it’s not, it limits itself too much.\\n\\nAfter much deliberation, I think the best place for this projector probably still is a living room space, but ceiling mounted with cabling solutions. Then the projector isn’t on the ground in the way of your seating (or blinding your children), cabling isn’t an issue, keystone isn’t an issue, and you get the superb brightness of the laser engine. But that does sort-of defeat the purpose of a projector with a handle and mobility…, and with no lens shift it’s still going to be somewhat of a nuisance. It seems you can’t win, here… Overall, I’ve struggled with this device. I wanted to love it. I hoped it would be a brilliant living-room solution for me without the complication of ceiling mounting. But it’s not.\\n\\n3.25 stars out of 5. A great idea, but not quite there…\\nRead more',\n",

To make even better, they lowered $100 of the price. Klipsch customer service was polite, but incompetent.

       " 'I bought these speakers (Klipsch Black Reference Theater Pack 5.1) and the Yamaha RX-V485BL receiver (changing from an Onkyo HT-R530 and a set of Cerwin Vega D9s that I rebuilt). I finally got it all set up a couple days ago and this is truly the best sound I’ve ever heard! This system spits out perfect sound with everything I throw at it (football games, television, different genres of music, movies from Blu-ray and streaming with a Roku TCL TV using SPIDF). I’m hearing sounds from instruments that I’ve never heard before when playing my favorite songs. I strongly recommend this system to anyone if going with 5.1 surround. I was thinking that if I were putting a system in a much larger room, I would have bought a 7.1 receiver and tried using the Klipsch as surround speakers with the Cerwin Vegas in the front and now after listening to the Klipsch, I would go with Klipsch all the way around.',\n",
       " 'When it comes to speaker sound, audio quality is completely subjective. Speaker companies build loyalty because of the way the sound is produced. I will admit that I am a huge fan of Klipsch’s sound. I have computer speakers by Klipsch (over 15 years old now!). I have my main TV area built around Klipsch speakers. When it came time to update my video game surround sound system (I had a very old Onkyo home theater in a box), I looked to Klipsch.\\n\\nThe Reference Series is one of the best on the market. I have listened to most of them through various receivers, and they all sound amazing. However, my room with my video game system has very limited space (aka man-cave), and although I wanted those large tower speakers, I simply had no room for them.\\n\\nEnter the Reference Theater Pack, which came out in November 2017. I could not find them in a store to listen to because they were so new. I bought them on instinct and trust that if I liked all the other Reference speakers, I would like these. They are small, yet contain all the power of the Reference line.\\n\\nOne word: Amazing! I hooked them up to my brand new Denon receiver. I used AudioQuest X2 speaker wire (14 gauge) and took my time to hook up everything correctly. I booted up my Playstation 4 and played some games and movies. The sound was unlike anything I have heard before. First, the new receiver was picking up the correct Dolby format from the Playstation games and movies. Second, the sound out of each individual speaker was crystal clear. The highs, lows, and mids were all there. From a small, tiny sound in the background to a voice in the foreground, everything came alive. I was able to crank up the sound, and although it was loud, it did not hurt my ears.\\n\\nOne thing that attracted me to Klipsch all those years ago was how they incorporate bass into the rest of their sound. Sometimes, I hear systems where I can hear all the sound, and then some bass is thrown in on top. It drowns out everything else. I have never liked that style of sound creation. Instead, Klipsch’s bass is equally integrated into the rest of the sound. In other words, I know my subwoofer is on, but it never overpowers anything else. It can rattle my walls without hurting my ears.\\n\\nThese are the best 5.1 speakers I have ever heard. Their size and power are unmatched.\\n\\nIf there is one negative, it is how Klipsch designed the speaker wire plug on these speakers. You have to thread the wire through the frame of the speaker and then through the plug itself, which requires you to push and hold in order to get the wire through. If I was using a small gauge wire, this might not be hard to do. But the X2 14 gauge wire is as big as these speakers will take, and it was very hard to hook them up. I had a flashlight under my chin, a finger pushing in the plug, and a very steady hand to get those wires in. On small slip and the copper wire bunched up. I am not sure why Klipsch made this so hard to do.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend these speakers. If you have a room limited by space, and these fit your needs, you will be very happy with this purchase. They have made every single game, movie, and TV show sound better and come alive with full audio immersion.\\nRead more',\n",

I put in 14' X 12' room and the supplied wires were plenty long enough. Definitely could fit bigger room. My frustration was in the mounting brackets. First, the wire comes out same hole as the mounting bolt, and there is a gap inside for the wire, so the bolt kept slipping into the gap instead of seating into correct hole. A small untreaded guide would have helped. Also, it is designed so that wire must come out DOWNWARD, so have to loop wire if running above.

       " 'I purchased this unit to allow me to use my analog Bose 701 speakers to output audio from my Samsung 55-inch TV. Here is why I am returning this unit:\\n\\n1. I have a 23+ year old JVC home theater receiver that was dated but working. I sent audio from my Samsung out the digital optical to the receiver (using PCM) and then to the Bose speakers with speaker wires. I was able to get this Pyle unit to work with the TV as well. So the basic required functionality of getting audio from the TV to the Bose speakers was accomplished with both the JVC and Pyle.\\n2. I was able to get the Samsung to allow me to control the volume through my JVC with the Xfinity remote. Hence I had one remote (Xfinity) that allowed me to do everything. The same could not be said for the Pyle. There was no 5 digit code that would allow the Xfinity remote to control the Samsung volume through the Pyle.\\n3. The Pyle manual (page 8) talks about an ARC (Audio return Channel) functionality to allow audio to be controlled from a single remote. I spent over 45 minutes on the phone with technical support and they were unable to provide me with any technical information to show me how to connect the unit (with other than an optical cable) to accomplish this. In fact, they recommended using optical and left me with the impression that ARC doesn\\'t even apply to this unit.\\n4. The Pyle manual talks about the \\'Display\\' function on the remote and unit.

At first I had a slight issue connecting to the optical. Even after switching my TVs audio out setting to optical, it wouldn't push the sound through the soundbar, so I flipped through the modes on the soundbar and when it cycled back to the optical setting, the audio started to work. Even with all of the great qualities of this soundbar, the one thing that I find overly annoying is the loud voice prompt every time I turn it on or switch modes.

       " 'I tried six of the top-rated full HD, battery-powered, portable projectors and found this one to be the best. Compared with other portable projectors, this has the best picture, most intuitive on-screen menu, and a true 2.5-hour battery life. You can get an additional 2.5 hours of projection time by plugging the LG PF50KA into a portable, rechargeable battery, such as the HALO Bolt 58830 ($110 on Amazon). (5.23.19 UPDATE: One reviewer noted problems with focus; I have not.)\\n\\nCAUTION #1: When comparing projectors, do not be fooled by brightness specifications in the product title or spec section that simply say \"lumens\" rather than \"ANSI lumens.\" (ANSI = American Nation Standards Institute). If the specs say \"LED lumens\" or just \"lumens,\" please recognize that your are reading advertising, not a real measure of brightness. The LG PF50KA is measured at 600 ANSI lumens. That\\'s as bright as any battery-powered portable projector on the market today. For apples-to-apples brightness comparisons, you need to know the ANSI lumens of each projector.\\n\\nCAUTION #2: When comparing projectors, be sure to check its \"native resolution.\" Just as with lumens, there is a lot of advertising fluff that contains abbreviations such as \"HD.\" Keep in mind that almost all modern projectors can play video files that were filmed at various resolutions, but they will downgrade the fidelity to what the projector\\'s graphics processor and native lamp capacity are. (Analogy: You can watch a 4K movie on your HD TV, but it will show up in HD, not 4K. You would need a 4K TV to display a 4K movie.) The LG PF50KA has a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 (width x height in pixels) considered \"Full HD\" by industry standards. It will display a 4K (3840 x 2160) movie at Full HD (1920 x 1080).

       " \"This is my first projector experience. I had a Wowoto H9 for a very short period of time and returned it because of a critical focus issue and bought this LG PF50KA instead on flash sale. Its been about 10 days since I received it and I am generally very happy with it. No issues with uneven focus on this one. **Updated on 4th week and very important. You can adjust display option. My mistake.**\\n\\nPro\\n\\n1. Its a major pro. The image quality. To begin with, 1080p (LG PF50KA) is way better than 720p (Wowoto H9).\\nPixels are easily spotted on the 720p screen but 1080p is smoothly faded with no obvious pixel presence in close inspection.\\nBrightness is really good too. Even in low light settings (in the morning with blinds, in my case when the sun is shining to the opposite direction of the projector screen from around 7am to 3pm), the image is still very bright. But when the sunlight is coming toward the screen (4pm to 7pm), it is not so favorable while still watchable. And obviously, a full light on room is not working for this projector at all and a complete dark room setting at night is the best.\\n\\n2. Smart TV capability. Hulu and Netflix are pre-installed and available on the go. LG contents movies and dramas are easy to navigate too.\\n\\n3. Battery capability. I haven't moved the projector from its set position yet, but I certainly think I can carry this to another room for movies or\\noutdoors. Not a pocket sized projector but still very much carry-able in your backpack or small designated carriers.\\n\\n4. Wireless connectivity. Works well with my bluetooth headphone. No hassle. Haven't tested other bluetooth connections like smartphones but there are many more connectivity available via wireless.\\n\\nCon\\n\\n1. No longer a Con. You can adjust display such as contrast, brightness, etc. So disregard this section. **updated**\\n\\n2. Amazon Prime video is not available on the go. The pre-installed Internet browser (Chrome) works well but it does not support Amazon Prime video streaming. Amazon fire stick will probably allow you to watch Amazon Prime videos. I haven't tried it yet, but it should work.\\n\\n3. Remote control could get better. I got used to it in 2 days but it seemed complicated at first. Too many buttons. Also, the buttons feel a bit too dull, making the whole menu navigation experience feel less crisp. Durability looks good instead.\\n\\n4. No zoom in out or position change. I knew about this before the purchase and it didn't cause too much trouble, but I'd much prefer to have the feature.\\n\\nOkay\\n\\n1. Fan noise level is okay. When there is sound it is barely noticeable. When there is no sound, it is quite noticeable. But, it did not bother me much for 8 hour straight use even though my projector is placed right next to me. With headphones on, the fan noise is unnoticeable. You can hear the fan running on open can headphones, but only when theres no sound. Not a big problem for me.\\n\\n2. Sound quality and loudness from this tiny projector is actually not bad. It depends on what source you are playing, but with Nintendo Switch hooked on, it gets pretty loud. The projector is set right next to my bed and if I put it over 50% loudness, I lower it down to 35% to 40% in less than 10 minutes because it hurts my ears. Nothing special but clear enough sound. Left right recognition is there, too but not great. Bass is not really there and I did not expect it to be. I think overall sound quality is okay for a small projector. Definitely acceptable. However, the internal speaker won't be good for Bluray audio or other multi channel support audio media. I played a 12GB movie and the internal speaker just sounded jammed. Foggy and very unclear. I suspect it is due to the amplified bass signals the input source is sending out. Otherwise, everything else worked just fine so far.\\n\\n3. Built-in TV interface. Its alright. Pretty fast to go through menus. Click response time is very short and the operation software has never been slow or draggy for me. Menus look clean and easy to navigate. Fast enough to change through differenct sources, too. Takes only 3 seconds to change from HDMI port#1 to port#2. Have not noticed any lag at all in terms of software interface. Also, the menu orders are customizable. For instance you can put Youtube 1st, HDMI#1 2nd, HDMI#2 3rd, Netflix 4th, etc. You can change pre-set display mode with short key button on the remote control. However, as I mentioned, there are too many buttons on the remote control and the buttons feel dull, rubbery, and somewhat hard. I believe it is made this way for durability, but the fast interface feels slower due to this not so snappy feeling remote control.\\n\\nFinal thoughts **updated**\\n\\n**I could give this projector 4 stars for not having the display customization**<<NOT TRUE. You can adjust display attributes all you want>> but decided give it a 5 stars because of the flash sale (about 100 off). The preset modes aren't bad either except for the two expert mode for different room situations which I think are pretty useless. The remote control gets on my nerves but its not like they feel cheap or don't work properly. Just lack some finesse. Overall, I am really glad I bought this 1080p projector over the 720p Wowoto H9.\\n\\n**update**\\n\\nI read someone's comment and realized you can adjust Contrast, Brightness, H Sharpness, V Sharpness, Color, Tint, Color Temperature, Dynamic Contrast, Super Resolution, Color Gamut, Edge Enhancer, Color Filter, Gamma, White Balance, Color Mnagement System. Wow.\\nRead more\",\n",

My gf was watching Netflix and she said she got “connection error” messages about 5 times in the span of two hours which is rediculous because the whole reason why I bought this for $50 more over the nighthawk was because I heard it was incredibly stable but that obviously wasn’t true.\\nAnother issue I had with the eero was that I couldn’t support 1gb over WiFi. I was told that it could but was misinformed which isn’t their fault but still, you’d think a router this expensive would be able to handle more than a cheaper router but instead it barely handles half.\\nNow, the biggest gripe I have with this router is the whole single SSID roaming speed thing. It sounds good in theory where devices and services that don’t need 5 ghz get put to 2.4 and vice versa but, at least in my case, it doesn’t actually do that. I have a gaming pc that I stream from maybe 10 feet away from the router and couldn’t get above 200 mbs because the router refused to roam to 5 ghz. And what makes it even worse and that there’s no way to set the router to 5ghz which just seems dumb to me.

It doesn’t support WiFi speeds over 600 (less than half of what the $150 nighthawk does), it only has one SSID and their “roaming” system isn’t smart enough to realize that a pc which is streaming while playing video games 10 feet away needs 5ghz speeds instead of 2.4.\\nRead more',\n",

It will provide fantastic speeds and will be a nice upgrade for older routers not capable of keeping up with the increasing internet speeds provided today by most ISPs.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Netgear decided to dramatically change the internal components and then still sell it under the same name (R6700). With that said, Amazon has a little product alert indicating either R6700 or R6700v2. Well, they are shipping the R6700v2 which does not match some of the specifications shown on this page (in particular the CPU speed).\\n\\nI know because after receiving a router that did not match, they offered to replace it and send the first version of the router (the one with the higher clock speeds as indicated on the actual product details) and ended up receiving the same thing (another V2).\\n\\nI will say that for those interested in a router that will not be flashed with custom software or that will not use other more advanced functions a router can provide, this is no problem. For those of us that know the hardware and know what we are expecting, that is a problem.\\n\\nI have it a 3 star because any company that makes an original version with better specs and then turns around and significantly changes this without changing the model number and making minor modifications on the box (see amazon's own photos - both boxes are pictured) simply does not deserve my trust. Speaking of ratings, many of the ratings you see here are lumped up with other Netgear products and also apply to the original more capable version.\\n\\nI encourage you do your research and check reviews from different sources.

       " \"This review applies to the Netgear R7000P ac2300 router. No compensation-bought it out of my own pocket.\\n\\nTwo months ago I was upgrading my home network from old 100mbs to gigabit. Did a lot of research and this R7000P seemed to be the best compromise between cost and capability. My son was also upgrading his home and agreed with my assessment. He bought first. Router was excellent so I bought mine shortly thereafter in mid March 2018.\\n\\nIt installed easily, plugged it in and it worked perfectly. Setup was a breeze. My home LAN is a mix of wireless and ethernet devices-two computers, a printer, five NAS devices connected through switches, some phones and tablets. Everything connected, the ethernet ports at 1000mbps.\\n\\nFast forward seven weeks. One bright May morning I looked at the router and noticed that the LAN ports LED indicators had changed from white to amber. The ports had switched to 100mbps. Not a good thing.\\n\\nSpeed tests were surprising-the wireless part of the router was still running as fast as always at 39MBps. The ethernet ports could barely hit 6MBps.\\n\\nSo I did all the things one normally does to show love for electronics. Rebooted, power cycled, reset to factory specs, flashed new firmware, direct connected computer to the modem(to verify the modem wasn't in some way failing) and to each lan port through brand new cat 5 and cat 6 cable. I even yelled at it hoping intimidation would work. No joy. The router management software reported and speed tests confirmed that the ethernet ports were under 100mbps, not even close to 1000mbps. Phone support was less than helpful.\\n\\nIt's beyond 30 days so I can't return it to Amazon and if I spend hours navigating a support system directing me do do all the troubleshooting I have already done I might eventually be able to return it for exchange. I pay shipping both ways, wait a week or three with no network.\\n\\nAbout a week after mine went wonky my son's failed in exactly the same way. He bought his at Walmart and had no trouble returning it and getting an ASUS.\\n\\nSo, the most expensive router I have ever owned is operating in cripple mode. When I can afford it I'll buy something else. Not Netgear.\\n\\nOne thing I did learn is that the 21,500+ reviews are not necessarily for this router. There is a filter switch near the review stars that lets you see only confirmed purchasers of this specific router-and that is lots less.

       " \"Update: It is now April 21, 2020 and we've been using the router for 2 months. It is still working perfectly for us and we have zero complaints. I highly recommend it!\\n\\nWe moved to the middle of nowhere about 7 years ago and it never occurred to us to check who provided TV/internet/phone at the new house before buying. We found out after buying the house that the only providers were satellite companies. We realized very quickly that first year that satellite sucks, the internet specifically. We got locked into a $75 a month plan with HughesNet for a year and never once were able to actually use the internet that whole year. It was really frustrating. We simply did not have home internet for the past 6 years due to a lack of a decent provider. This past week Spectrum finally moved their service to our road. We immediately signed up. I knew I wasn't paying them $5 a month to rent a router from them but I also wasn't sure at all how to pick out a router myself. I've always been pretty tech savvy but when you lose access(and a need) to those things you stop keeping up with them, I was seriously behind on all the new updates that have been made over the last several years. I knew I didn't want to spend more than $50 on a router and after doing some research I finally decided on this TP-Link AC1200 and basically just hoped for the best. Some of the reviews weren't great so I was nervous. It arrived a day after our internet was installed so I set it up by myself. It took me all of 20 mins from unboxing to the whole house having Wi-Fi, it was VERY easy. I love that it has it's own app, a very convenient feature. We live in a 2000sq. ft., one floor, manufactured home. These homes have pretty thin walls so the signal reaches from one end to the other very easily. We are also extremely heavy on our data usage in this family and while it's only been a couple of days now it has had zero trouble keeping up with us. We've had zero buffering while streaming & using our phones, everything has been working very quickly. We have several smart TVs, cell phones, a laptop, a printer & a PS4 connected to it at the moment. The technician from Spectrum who installed our internet also said this was a good option for our 200mbps plan. I hope this helps someone make up their mind on whether this router will be a good choice for them. I will update the review if anything changes but as of now this seems to have been a pretty solid purchase and I'm happy with it.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"A very much needed improvement over the older 2 netgear AC 750 router.

       " \"There are actually two routers on this page as of this writing: w/ MU-MIMO is the brand new Archer A6 and w/o MU-MIMO is the older C1200. I don't know why they did it like this but both are excellent routers and all you need unless you have some very complicated home network setup or live in a very, very large house. Also, the only real difference between the two is that the A6 is much newer and sleeker looking and it has an MU-MIMO option, which is turned off by default and that you'll probably never even notice. It's also cheaper than the older C1200 right now.\\n\\nI had the C1200 for a few years (V1) and it never gave me a single problem. The only reason I bought the A6 is that the C1200 (at least the V1 - they're on V3 now I think) had a problem with IPV6 networking with Comcast internet. If you care about that at all (and you probably don't), I've had the new A6 for several days now and the IPV6 support has been flawless, as expected. Buy this, do the quick default setup without changing any settings (unless you want to - you can adjust a lot of things) and your wireless internet will be as fast as you ISP and modem allow.\",\n",
       " \"We have been using an Arris SurfBoard SBG7600AC2 for a few months. We started having issues with the WiFi signal dropping out at least every day, sometimes multiple times a day. Each time I would have to unplug / reset the modem / router. Not fun if you're in the middle of binge watching Netflix. I did some research and found the well known problems with routers and modems using the Intel Puma chipset. Intel should be ashamed. They've known about the faulty chipsets for years and continue to sell their garbage. More research into the alternative products and we found this router. Highly rated by every review site such as Tom's Hardware and PC Mag. Excellent reviews on Amazon. I was really tempted to buy one with the A7 or A9 chipset... If the A6 chipset is as great as everyone says, then it stands to reason the A7 and A9 should be even better... right? Not entirely true. Sure, I could have paid $300 for the latest and greatest technology but the A7 was actually older and had less tech than the A6. I struggled with my decision... How could a $40 router be better than a $120 router.... I ordered the $40 router with the knowledge that I could always return it and spend the extra $$ for the bigger better version. I have a background as a microsoft systems engineer and cisco certified eng. so I'm not completely stupid no matter what the wife tells you. So... this $40 router is surprisingly good..... as in REALLY GOOD! Setup involved my iPhone downloading their app, setting up an account and setting a password. I snapped a photo of the info sticker on the bottom of the router for the network ID and password. I logged onto the wifi with my iPhone, launched the app... it found the router and after a few simple questions the process was complete. The software interface is basic compared to more robust routers, but for 95% of home users it's all and maybe even more control than you'll ever truly use. We kept the old Arris and we're using it as the cable modem only...** IMPORTANT BITS HERE** turned off the wifi signals inside the old Arris modem / router for both the 2.4 ghz and the 5 ghz wifi so it wouldn't interfere with the new TP-Link router. We have strong signals throughout the house (2000 sq ft 3 level). Really impressed so far.... I'll update if I see any issues.... still skeptical of a $40 router being this good. **UPDATE** Ran multiple speed tests from different sites... all were within a few mbs of 200 mb download.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m conflicted when it comes to the D-Link AC2600 Smart MU-MIMO Dual Band Mesh Router (DIR-2640-US Black). The thing is that I know that most people don\\'t know what a router is, or what it does. They will never go into the settings of the router, beyond just changing the admin password and their wireless SSID and WPA2 settings. I\\'ll give a bit more in-depth review anyway.\\n\\nThe DIR-2640 comes in a slick retail box. Inside, you get the router, a larger than expected power brick, and a flat Ethernet cord. The router is handsome, with 4 flip-up, non-replaceable antennas. Interestingly, the unit sports purple LEDs for the indicator lights. Physical setup consists of plugging in the DC adapter (with it\\'s shockingly short power cord), and connecting an Ethernet cable from the router\\'s WAN port to your cable/DSL modem or fiber transceiver.\\n\\n\"Soft\" setup, for me, consisted of connecting to the router\\'s admin page. The router defaults to being a DHCP server, and to parking itself on 192.168.0.1. After changing the admin password of the device, I changed the base subnet and DHCP pool range. Next, I changes the SSID and WPA2 password. By default, the DIR-2640 does not allow you to set the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz SSIDs independently. Instead, the \"Smart Connect\" feature causes them to both have whatever SSID you specify. I then enabled and set up the \"Guest Zone\", which is basically a VLAN\\'d guest network. This is a great feature for all of your IoT devices, since it\\'s best to not have them on your main LAN. The last things I did were to turn off WPS (it\\'s insecure), and turn off IPv6 DHCP.\\n\\nWhile the management interface is clean and easy to use, it\\'s super obvious that the router is just REALLY BASIC in terms of its feature set. It\\'s almost like D-Link decided it was best to not offer anything more than the most basic features for fear of confusing the average home user. There\\'s port forwarding (only 24 entries), but no port triggering. There\\'s QoS, but it must be by host (no protocol or port option), and there are only 5 \"buckets\" for prioritizing devices - so weird. There\\'s some rudimentary access control, but nothing that\\'s really robust enough to be considered parental control. There\\'s a VPN, but you can\\'t automatically generate profiles for non-iOS devices. The frustrating thing is that you know that the SoC is more than capable of doing all of the \"big\" router things... D-Link just doesn\\'t let it.\\n\\nAs far as the router\\'s performance goes, it is fine. I have the DIR-2640 on a 450 Mbit/s dl/ 25 MBit/s ul connection, with about 30 connected devices. I fired up Chariot and sustained bandwidth didn\\'t suffer, even with the NAT on the device handling 3000 open connections. Not bad for a home router. There\\'s no CPU utilization indicator, so it\\'s hard to say how it would scale to a 1 Gbit/s connection, but I\\'d assume it would be ok. The wireless performance is extremely good, with a Pixel 3 XL and an iPhone 11 Pro Max both managing to transfer at 300-350 Mbit/s from 30 feet (through two walls). The 2.4Ghz range is particularly good, too. This router supports mesh networking, but I didn\\'t have a satellite AP to try with it.\\n\\nThe bottom line is this: if you want a set-and-forget home router with good wireless performance, the DIR-2640 is definitely worth a look. However, if you are the type of person that will need to actually get in and need to do anything moderately advanced (there\\'s no VLAN support, for example), then this is not for you. Conditionally recommended.\\n\\n❤️ If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below\\nRead more',\n",

       " \"Sadly I had problems. Right out of the box the router was super easy to install and configure. No problems and no questions. After using it for several hours I noticed the speed was no where near what my old router provided. Comparing the speed when directly connected to the modem and then with a connection to one of the lan ports I found that the speed was less than 10% of the direct connection. I contacted Tech Support, which was very good and they had me do thorough testing (several times). I had changed the default LAN address to 192.168.1.1 from the default. When I changed back to the 192.168.0.1 default I found the speed went up significantly. 70% to 80% of the direct modem connection. Since I expect near 100%, I assumed I must have a defective router. I requested a return from Amazon and within a day I received another router. Hooked it up, did my testing and STILL only 70% - 80% of the max speed. I worked with Tech Support for 5 days with no solutions to my problem. They referred the ticket to the senior support folks but I can't wait on a solution that may never come. Luckily my old router still had WiFi functioning (but no working LAN ports) so I'm still limping along until I decide on a new router.\\n\\nI suggest new buyers do the following as soon as you plug in the router: 1) Update the firmware first thing. 2) Don't make any changes to the default LAN address (yet) 3) Do a speed test between your PC and modem and then do another from one of the LAN ports on the router. Make sure it's pretty close to the modem speed (my old router is between 96% and 99% of max) 4) If all looks good at this point make your changes to the LAN address (if needed) and check again.

I paid about $170 for the Netgear back then, and, after looking at various choices I really wasn't swayed enough to spend the same amount (or more) on its replacement. So I read a bunch of reviews and critiques on non-Negear routers and thought I would take a chance on this model, the TP-Link AC1900 @ $79.95. It arrived the next day and I found it easy to set up (about 10 min). Frankly, I was blown away at the D/L speeds I was getting from this inexpensive device! With our old router, we were able to get 40-50Mps on the opposite side of our house, using several devices and I thought that was pretty good. But with this new router, the D/L speeds shot up to between 180-225 Mps on the 5Ghz band - exceptional.

       " 'I have typically changed ISPs every year or two when they jack up the introductory rates.

So I decided to get my own router to end that nuisance and meddling. I don\\'t need more speed than required for 2-3 HD video streams, so at less than $100, the TP-Link AC1900 Archer A9 seemed attractive.\\n\\nSo in a week the router has been configured without problems for about 5 wired (with an ethernet switch) and 5 wireless devices, including two slingboxes and an industrial temperature monitoring computer requiring static routing and port forwarding with DDNS service.

My Dell laptop speed tests at 20-25 mbps max up/down in most places up to 25 feet away in the house and 50 feet away in the yard when the signal is set to \"medium\" strength. At 100 feet from the house the signal dropped to about 3 down, 6 up or 12 down, 12 up depending on laptop orientation. On \"high\" strength the poor orientation values doubled. Similar low speed tests and laptop orientation effects were noted in a bathroom separated from the router by twelve feet and six one inch thick plaster wall layers. In no case would I expect problems streaming a video.\\n\\nMy hardwired computer speed tests at 200 Mbps down, 35 up, which is what my ISP provides, so I cannot comment on higher speed results.

Give it 5-10 minutes and hopefully you'll be good to go.\\n\\nThe interface looks a bit dated and clonky but most do. Seems the least priority is given to creating a clean, attractive interface for all these things, but coming from an Airport Extreme where you have essentially no features to work with, this is a dream. The ability to edit the names of the clients is something I was never able to do before and it really makes a difference.\\n\\nI wanted something with the ability to kick clients off the network while I am using the Quest to ensure it has no bandwidth competition with devices that are not in use at the time the Quest is being used, but then put them back on without having to jump through hoops, re-entering passwords and such. I have a lot of devices on my network and while they may not be in use, they are still hovering around and eating up some bandwidth even while idling.\\n\\nThis router allows that in an easy peasy way but the icons used are confusing. First, if you go to the Network map, clients section, you will see a list of all the clients on your network. You can click the pencil next to the name of the device and change it to make life easier. On the right side, if you click Block, that client gets blacklisted and cannot connect to the network. If you click View Blacklist, you will see all of the blocked clients and there is a garbage can icon on the right. This is a confusing and poor icon choice because most people would think that this will remove the client entirely. It doesn't. It simply puts the client back on the whitelist. It's a great thing to have, for example:\\n\\nLet's say you have a Zoom meeting and want to ensure that there's as little connection issues as possible. You can block all other clients on the network that are not needed and have all the bandwidth to yourself for your meeting and when it's over, just click the garbage can on each device in the blacklist and poof! they are all able to connect again.\\n\\nI am not really understanding the point of the QoS feature on this device because in the past when I've set up QoS in a work environment, you are able to directly allocate bandwidth to devices. Ideally, this would be what you would use if you had a Zoom call rather than kicking clients off for a time. With this router's QoS, you have two choices: On or Off. Each device listed has a Priority switch that is turned on or off. You can turn on the Priority switch for one, some or all devices, but there's nothing else, so you have no idea how bandwidth allocation is implemented here.\\n\\nUnder the On/Off switch for QoS, there is a bandwidth allocation box for both upload and download with each set at 1000. You can change this number, but again, it doesn't tell you how it will divvy out that bandwidth to the clients. If you only have one device with the Priority turned on, you are left to wonder what that client is getting as opposed to other devices on the network. That's kind of a shame because you can prioritize a device for Always or for a couple of hours. Would seem the perfect set up for a Zoom meeting as you can give Priority to your device for a set amount of time and the router will release that restriction at the end of the hour or two or whatever you chose without you having to interact with the admin page at all. Unfortunately, you cannot enter times: i.e,. Priority from 10 a.m. to noon. You can choose Always, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 4 hours.\\n\\nI'm not sure what people are talking about regarding monthly fees for Parent Controls. I don't have kids, but opened it up and you can add a child's computer as a device, block certain keywords from being searched online and limit the days/times that your child can get online. I didn't see anything about fees or payment for those features.\\n\\nI have noticed more zip in my Quest 2 since setting up this router and am quite pleased with it so far. I set up a 5ghz network set to AX only for the Quest's exclusive use, a 2.4ghz Guest Network for all the Echos, Kindles, switches for lights, etc., and a 2.4ghz network for laptops, iPads, etc.\\nRead more\",\n",

       "[\"Pros and Cons. But I think it's a cool laptop.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Speaker placement is superb (right above the keyboard)\\n- Screen is decent (720p but I don't mind)\\n- Keyboard is decent\\n- Has one USB C port and sever legacy ports (hdmi, 2x USB A, SD card slot, headphone port) Awesome versatility!\\n\\nCons:\\n- Trackpad stops working for almost a minute, at least once every hour or two. I usually put the laptop to sleep and then I wake it up again and that resolves it. However, it's not worth the trouble.\\n- Sometimes the brightness buttons don't work. Neither does the brightness slider on Windows either. So the screen stays at a consistent brightness.\\n\\nI like this laptop but I must return it. Trackpad is important to me, especially for working on the go.\\n\\nEvery unit might provide a different experience. Maybe the next unit I purchase will be better and have no remarkable flaws but I won't take that chance. I'll get one from Lenovo for around the same price.\\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.\\n\\nQUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.\\n\\nPROS --\\nIncredible Price to Performance Ratio\\nVery well built, with no cheap parts\\nFull-size, comfortable keyboard\\nSmall and lightweight\\nGood design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)\\nFull Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware\\nInternal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot\\nI could keep going... it's $200.\\n\\nCONS --\\nNo backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)\\nSome irksome viewing angle problems\\nMaddeningly little built in storage\\nAlmost too little RAM\\n\\nI've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):\\n\\nIntroduction (above)\\nWeight & Build\\nKeyboard and Trackpad\\nScreen\\nBattery\\nPerformance (including Gaming)\\nWebcam\\nSpeakers & Sound\\nSoftware\\nOther (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)\\nConclusion\\nLinks to Accessories\\n\\nLet me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.\\n\\nThe second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.\\n\\nWith that being said, let me get into the details.\\n\\nWEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.\\n\\nIt's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.\\n\\nThe screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.\\n\\nKEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.\\n\\nAnother note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.\\n\\nAlso, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.\\n\\nThe trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.\\n\\nSCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.\\n\\nThe screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.\\n\\nThere's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.\\n\\nUPDATE: There's seems to be an issue with the screen calibration. Frequently, it will turn noticeably yellow, and by right clicking on the desktop and clicking 'display settings,' it seems to at least temporarily fix it. I believe very much this is a software issue, so it's unlikely you'll encounter it, but it would be interesting to know if others are encountering the same problem.\\n\\nBATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.\\n\\nSide note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.\\n\\nPERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.\\n\\nWell, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.\\n\\nI LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.\\n\\nIMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.\\n\\nI was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.\\n\\nWEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.\\n\\nOf special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.\\n\\nSPEAKERS & SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.\\n\\nIf you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.\\n\\nThe headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.\\n\\nSOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.\\n\\nOTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.\\n\\nOther reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.\\n\\nIt has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.\\n\\nIf you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.\\n\\nDuring normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.\\n\\nSide note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.\\n\\nI like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.\\n\\nEither way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.\\n\\nCONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.\\n\\nLINK TO ACCESSORIES - Some may find this helpful. These are subject to change - Amazon is always adding or removing their product offerings, so if one's not available, these should at least give you an idea of what to look for. But at the time of this writing, these are the accessories I purchased for it, and that all work.\\n\\nSD Card (256gb, $40) - Lots of storage to hold a small collection of movies, music, or pictures. Plenty fast enough.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCR3316/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nLaptop Case ($12) - The laptop fits perfectly.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VVLE5CG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nMicrofiber Clothes ($8) - You can never have too many of these.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050R67U0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nWireless Mouse ($16) - Oddly, the little LEDS in it aren't nearly as bright as advertised, but it's a great mouse. Good click, the scroll wheel is nice. And it has an option between Bluetooth or dongle. Charges off of USB, so no batteries needed.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085HR8VPM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nMessenger Bag ($32) - Fits the Laptop [in the case] like a glove. It's a little large, but it's stylish and has lots of pockets.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072PVTHR9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\nRead more\",\n",

The S21 has a smaller bezel, which increases screen size. The S21 is also a bit lighter. I spent an hour watching a YouTube video on the features and this phone does it all. It also has a MUCH better camera than the S8. I\\'ve only had it a bit over 24 hours but I\\'ve been playing with it, off and on, all day and the battery life still shows 66%. I took it off the charger at 6:00 AM and it\\'s now 8:48 PM, so I have to say the battery life is quite good. I\\'m glad I was \"forced\" to buy it!

       " \"My last 3 phone purchases have been Panasonic phones prior to obtaining the AT&T phones. My main reason for purchasing was the ROBOCALL Blocking feature. Somehow my number got placed on the softheaded list and I was getting robo calls from people who claimed their names were Bob or George but sounded like they were working out of a Bombay call center. Traditional number block features do not work against the scammers, they spoof local numbers. The reviews here on sound clarity and range also convinced me to try AT&T. I did not have a problem with the old Panasonic in regard to sound clarity , but I bought an extra system for my sister who has issues with her current system. I got tired of asking her to repeat what she was telling me on phone conversations. I will list the Pros in their level of importance:\\n\\nRobo call block feature and call screening and call anounce for non caller identified numbers, numbers in your phonebook can pass through unscreened , or with screening. This feature justifies purchasing this phone and dealing with it's detractions.\\n\\nDuplex voice operatioon, unlike most speaker phones both parties can speak simoultaneously. This is a great feature.\\nGood backlight on the numerals which are clear on a black button ( Other controls are not backlit or illuminated)\\n\\nTransmission distance is excellent tested by intercom from inside the house through brick walls to about 100 feet outside.\\nSound clarity is OK\\nHandset is sleek, slim and light\\n\\nNow the cons\\nThe battery is proprietary, it's small and it does not retain a charge for very long. If you forget to place the handset in the cradle charger at night, forget about using the phone the next day. I prefer Panasonic's system which uses two AAA rechargable batteries which last for days.\\n\\nCannot stand the phone up. The panasonic handsets are made so that you can set the phone upright on your desk or table taking up less real estate and making the phone easier to locate.\\nIntercom system is clunky, You have to scroll through 7 to 10 keystrokes to intercom another handset.\\n\\nSpeakerphone cannot be engaged when intercomming another handset until they answer the page and there is a slight delay where both parties greet each other several times before a conversation occurs if both are using speaker phone.\\n\\nCannot name the individual handsets. Panasonic allows handsets to be individualized and this makes intercomming and call transfering much easier. Instead of guessing or remembering who is handset 4.\\n\\nNo individual quiet or sleep mode on the handsets. If you engage sleep mode it is global. If you have a handset in a bedroom and do not wish to be awakened but wish to have other family members recieve calls, it's not possible. Panasonic allows for individualized sleep mode and they can be set to specific times. The AT&T has a timer, it's clunky, ie: sleep for 1 hour, 2 hour etc....\\n\\nSound clarity is ok. Not fantastic. Intercomming by lower level phone leaves something to be desired. Sound volume is lacking, the recipient has to talk noticably louder than when using the panasonic phone and even has to pick the phone up to speak making the speaker phone feature questionable. I do not know if it is distance from the base transmitter, the phone remains in ECO mode which appears to be global or perhpas it is just a display feature that does nothing? Conversly we tested distance and clarity was good from inside the house through brick walls to 100 feet outside.\\nRead more\",\n",

I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!\\nThe quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.\\nI love these headphones, they have already changed my life for the better!\",\n",
       " \"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.\\n\\nPairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet. I bought this on Prime Day thinking I was getting a good deal and Paid $49.99 with $3 off but found out other purchase this for around $25/$30. Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.\\n\\nUPDATE REVIEW...\\nThis is an update. TOZO Customer service is wonderful they reached out to me to rectify the issue. They issued another TOZO Bluetooth. The previous one works great with my devices just not with my smart tv. Haven’t tried the new one yet but Will keep you posted. Thanks TOZO',\n",
       " \"Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.\\n\\nWith a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.\\n\\nDue diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.\\n\\nThe sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.\\n\\nBattery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.\\n\\nPairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.\\n\\nAll in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'Wow. These are absolutely phenomenal headphones. I bought them about a year and a half ago and I use them all the time. I had a pair of on ear headphones from a no-name brand a few years ago and, while they served their purpose, they were not impressively loud and became a little aggravating on the ears after a while. These sit very comfortably on my head while I do chores around the house or yard work etc. I run a mobile auto detailing business in my spare time and use them for that as well. I don’t have a particularly large head and they fit nicely, but I imagine they would be better for someone with a big noggin. If I find myself looking down for too long they will start to slip off my head. I wouldn’t even attempt to do any kind of cardio with these. Weightlifting, sure but running - no. They are too loose and when using the noise canceling feature, any excess movement makes it crackle.\\n\\nThe noise canceling is pretty decent. It’s not Bose quality but it’s plenty powerful to muffle a mower, vacuum or grinder. It almost entirely mutes plane noise. Like I mentioned, it doesn’t take much jostling to make it crackle, but if it becomes too annoying I just turn the NC off.\\n\\nSound quality is also pretty good. Depending on the app/song I’m listening to, it can get EXTREMELY loud. So much so that I have to turn it down - which is saying something because I listen to my music on full blast most of the time. Sound quality is marginally better with the NC on, but marginally louder with NC off.\\n\\nBuild construction is solid enough. Kind of feels like a few steps up from just cheap plastic. Don’t get me wrong - it IS cheap plastic but it presents itself well. Pads are very soft and so far the body has been durable. I’ve dropped these on the ground a few times and, while they are covered in scratches, they are still performing fabulously.\\n\\nFinally, and very importantly, the battery life on these is UNPRECEDENTED. I mean I will use these for hours a day for like 2 weeks in a row before even thinking about charging them. I think they advertise 16 hours, but no joke I have probably used these for 40+ hours between charges and they still weren’t dead. Unbelievable. There is also a widget for the iPhone but I’ve found it to be entirely inaccurate.\\n\\nBluetooth connection is lightning fast and has superb distance. In an open field I’ve used them further than 80’ from my phone.\\n\\nGripes: I have only a few.\\nMy biggest gripe is the piss poor Siri support. There is not a designated Siri button which sucks. And it wouldn’t be so bad, but there is about a 4 second delay between Siri activation and the prompt to begin speaking. I hope they addressed this with the E8’s.\\n\\nThere is an LED on the command switch that never turns off and is quite bright. Also not a huge deal, but it bothers my wife if I try to wear them in bed.\\n\\nLastly, the hinges of the earpieces have become a little squeaky and loose after a year. Overall, these are minute gripes that I actually had to think about to put in here.\\n\\nOverall these are a fantastic set of headphones and have earned their 5-stars from me. I bought another product from Cowin and had to get in touch with their customer support and was very pleased. I will buy from Cowin in the future\\n\\nUpdate: 10-11-18\\n\\nI am still using these headphones and continue to be blown away by their deceptively good quality. I mean these suckers refuse to die. I’ve added a few photos this time to show how much abuse they’ve taken over the past few years. The leather is gnarled over the headpiece. There are scratches everywhere. I’ve even dropped this pair off my roof by accident. They didn’t care. They laughed and kept playing the ‘Man of Steel’ film score. Not even joking - that really happened. The battery life remains miraculous. Still getting 30+ hours of play time on full volume. That is an absolute feat considering the common life of Li-Ion batteries. The buttons still work. The Noise Cancelling still works. And despite their twisted appearance, they remain unconventionally comfortable. In my previous post I mentioned that they had started to squeak around the hinges. Yeah that just stopped. I am seriously astounded by these headphones and wonder if I’ll ever even need to upgrade to the E8’s. In any case - Cowin has still got my vote when it comes down to a reasonably priced headphone of extraordinary longevity.\\n\\nUpdate: 12-17-19\\n\\nMy (probably) final thoughts:\\nThese headphones have transcended my expectations in quality - So much so that I’ve anthropomorphized them. Yup they’re basically my buddy. I have been using these every day for 3 YEARS and have not had one single issue with them. Sure the skin is falling off.. And... uh... yeah nope that’s it. That’s literally the only problem plaguing these headphones. I was broke when I bought these (still broke but that’s not relevant) and they have gone above and beyond their purpose for how much I paid for them. The battery STILL lasts days, the sound quality has not diminished at all, and I am still beating the snot out of these things. I was expecting these to last MAYBE 18 months before I had to search for something else. 3 years later, I’m now looking into a pair of AirPods to replace my dailies, but I’ll be keeping these as backups and for studio work - probably forever. I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon (remember that thing about being broke?) but I hold these headphones with the utmost respect as possibly the best purchase I’ve ever made on this site.\\n\\nCowin - you guys are doing something right. You’ve made a lifelong customer and I can’t recommend your products enough. Well done.\\n\\nNow go buy these headphones!\\n\\nUpdate: 05-31-20\\n\\nUn...Be...Lievable.\\n\\nIn the time since my last update, I have acquired a set of AirPod Pros. In that same amount of time, they have died. 3 whole months of daily use and they decided not to work anymore. They were 250$. 3 months. I mentioned in my last update that I’d be keeping my E7’s as a set of backups and, well, it has come to be. And THEY STILL WORK LIKE THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM. ARE YOU KIDDING ME COWIN!? The ear pieces have worn off, exposing cloth underneath the leather. This does cause them to hold moisture a lot from sweating (and uh.. smell too..) but that’s the only development in the problems department. I have never had a consumer electronic blow me away the way these headphones have. I LOVE them. Unfortunately I’m out 250 bucks on my AirPods but I learned my lesson.

       " \"I had a pair from this headphone line in the past, and used them until they basically fell apart (one side stopped working, and the cushioning material for the ears eventually peeled away.) And yet after trying myriad other brands, I rate these as my personal best. After my first pair died (took several years of daily use), I went on a quest to try a bunch of different headphones. After wasting hundreds of dollars over the past couple years on everything from fancy $200 pairs, cheap Amazon-branded pairs, and plenty of random ones from places like Big Lots or Walmart, I finally just came back to these for a meager $15. There's simply no beating the combination of comfort (especially for people with glasses!), sound quality, and price. I work in front of a computer for hours at a time, and almost always have headphones (and eye glasses) on. I probably have a larger than average head shape too. Every single other pair I have tried ended up making my ears hurt before long, except this one. While the construction quality is decent, I do expect to run through a new pair every couple years, but at this price point, it's really hard to complain. In summary, I am so thankful these are back in my life.\",\n",
       " 'These phones sound really nice, for being under $20. I have owned at least 30 different headphones since 1974, and these sound as good as any of the $100 Sennheisers I had back when Elton John\\'s \"Rocket Man\" was new music. The power requirement for the voice coils in these phones is remarkably low: They sound great for listening to music on a cell phone or tablet, and you won\\'t even have to crank the volume up to maximum. Some of the headphones I have owned recently don\\'t work well with mobile devices, requiring more output power than the audio chip in a cell phone can provide - that won\\'t be a problem with these Sony ZX-110 phones. They sound just fine on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S at 50% of max volume. Frequency response is very good for economy priced phones, with clear treble and adequate bass response to let you \"feel\" the drums and bass guitar. Soprano and contralto vocals sound nice and clear, without that \"muddy\" sound that cheap phones give that don\\'t have enough high-frequency response. These phones fold up into a very small, compact footprint that is easy to store in a medium or large purse, or any briefcase, backpack, or laptop computer bag. The cord is 3 feet, and has a 90° angled plug. This cord length is great for use with a cell phone in a shirt pocket, although not really long enough for home use with a desktop computer. If you are going to use these phones to listen to music on a home stereo or desktop computer, you will need an extension cord, but these aren\\'t terribly expensive.\\nCOMFORT: Sony got this right: these phones grip your head just firmly enough to stay in place, without squeezing you to death. I have had a couple of Sony phones that were horrible in this respect, with way too much compression on an average sized head; that\\'s not a problem with these phones. The ear pads are very comfortable, and they don\\'t press hard enough on your earlobes to make you need to take your earrings off to use the phones.\\n\\nSUMMARY: A Typical Sony economy-priced headphone with much better sound than you might have expected at this price point. Folds up very small for carrying in a purse or laptop computer bag, Very comfortable to wear for up to several hours.\\n\\nPRODUCT RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\\nRead more',\n",
       " \"I loved these Stereo Headphones when I first got them. They were comfortable to wear (I hate ear buds) and the sound was surprisingly good considering the low $15.00 Cost. Now the bad news, I've had the Headphones approximately two months and the connection through the plug has gone south. You have to constantly put pressure on the connector plug to get any sound at all. I guess I'll move on to another manufacturer test my luck there.\",\n",
       " 'UPDATE: 1/15/21 Both headphones are still going strong. Just thought I\\'d update after my daughter has had her\\'s for a decent amount of time.\\nUPDATE: 10/14/20 Bought a 2nd pair for our 3rd grader to use at school. Originally, we bought her the lightweight, on ear styled, Koss brand headphones on here, but she thought they were too tight and uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. Especially because she wears glasses, and now a mask as well. She loved these tho! Said they felt great, and has been using them at school for just over 6weeks with no problems.\\n\\nORIGINAL: We bought these for my mother in-law to use with her t.v. because she is starting to become hard of hearing. We wanted to check everything out before setting everything up for her, and we found these were made well, had good sound volume and quality, were comfortable for a decent length of time, and overall were good headphones. She wanted to have two different styles. These were the one style that she was able to use in her 3.5mm tablet as well, which was an added bonus. She had hoped both pairs would work in her tablet, but the on ear computer style Panasonic did not fit, but still works for the t.v. set up, which was her main concern. The Panasonic had a smaller pin, so it might have worked in a cell phone. She did not try it, but I will update once she does. I wish we had thought to try ourselves. We purchased everything on Amazon for her setup. This pair fit all of our heads and have a lot of adjustability. They do show which way to put them on by marking the back of the ear pad section with \"L\" for left & \"R\" right, as shown in my photos. These are decently padded, and if taken care of should last. Overtime, this padded material may start to crack and chip away, but they\\'re pretty good for this value. The Panasonic ones were more lightweight when wearing for long periods, so she\\'s still glad she got both pair. We waited 2mnths to review so she had a chance to really use these and see how they worked, and we told her we\\'d return them if needed, but she is happy with them. They\\'ve really helped with her quality of life. She had stopped watching t.v. for a time because she just couldn\\'t hear it anymore, so I\\'m happy the volume and sound quality was good enough so she could use them daily. We may order another pair of these for our daughter. I will update if these fail. I hope my pictures help give you an idea of what to expect in person.\\nRead more',\n",

I imagine that people here aren't lying and that there may be some variation in the quality of the items received which led to some of the negative reviews. These may very well be an extremely well-crafted fake, but I can't tell the difference. The claim about the cord being slicker than the Apple store ones is false too btw. Both cords are slick and I believe that is to keep it more rigid and to prevent tangles. Hope this helps someone.\",\n",

       " \"The best of two worlds - it can be both wireless and wired\\n\\nI have been struggling to find the perfect headphones, mostly because I love the wireless ones for their convenience: that you can move around the house and listen to music/audiobooks while your phone is charging, at the same time, I am constantly forgetting to charge the headphones. Wired headphones will never turn off, but you are literally attached to the source of music. That's why these headphones have become a perfect option for me, and their first benefit is:\\n\\nCONVENIENCE. These headphones come with a standard 3.5mm cable, so when the battery is out, you can simply plug the cable in, and continue using them! For someone like me, it's a great find. So far, with the cable attached, the sound comes only from one dynamic though, but it's good enough for me, especially if I'm listening to an audiobook in the middle of my daily walk.\\n\\nSOUND. I really liked the sound - it's very clear as if someone is singing directly in your ear 🙂 Everything sounds great in them so far: from classical music to Rammstein.\\n\\nNOISE CANCELLATION. These headphones already offer partial noise cancellation because of their over-the-ear design, but with ANC turned on, it's even better! It completely blocked out the sounds of a lawn mower outside while I was testing them. So they are really effective.\\n\\nFIT. I liked that the shape of the over-the-ear pieces is oval, and kind of mimicking the shape of the ear. The fit is nice and soft, not too tight, not too loose, just perfect. I can wear them for a long time.\\n\\nCONTROLS. Unlike some of my other headphones, these ones provide a lot of control functions, for example, you can pause a song, skip to the next one, adjust volume, and answer the calls. I love it because with my previous headphones, I could only adjust the volume and turn them on and off.\\n\\nPACKAGING. The packaging is nice and stylish. It comes in a black box with a silver drawing of the headphones, and inside there is a neat case that you can use later to carry the headphones in your bag or a backpack and not worry about them being scratched or damaged. The package also has a charging cable, a 3.5mm cable, and a pretty straightforward instruction.\\n\\nI am happy with these headphones so far, I hope they serve me for a long time because I really like them.\\nRead more\",\n",

The USB cord for the charger is a little short and the product does not come with a USB outlet adapter, but honestly I would rather have the savings of not including these pieces so I didn't bother docking a point for it. The dock itself has a battery, so needing to switch a cord every now and again is not a big deal to me. The sound quality was surprisingly good.

My gold standard is the Sony MDR-V6, which 30 years ago sold for almost four times the price; today's Sony professional headphones, the best in the business, sell for the expected higher prices.\\n\\nA studio headphone is definitely NOT a headphone made for 'listening' per se. Most consumer headphones for listening have frequency responses tailored to the intended audience. For instance the Beats headphones put out a strong bass (as do many others). Studio headphones must tell the truth; that is, they must have a flat, wide range response with no colorations, no phase distortions, and no intentional emphases. The engineer needs to hear exactly what's going on, exactly as it sounds.\\n\\nStudio headphones also need to be comfortable. If you're sitting offstage recording three hours of opera, the headphones had better not pinch, give headaches, cause sweating, or otherwise irritate and detract attention from a demanding job requiring constant focus.\\n\\nThe Amazon studio headphones fail, as studio headphones, on most every count.\\n\\nThe bass, while tight and solid, is over-emphasized. The lower mids are murky and the frequency response rolls off so there is no transparency and the barest of high end response. This in turn makes the sound stage narrow and constricted. Fortunately there is no phasiness. But overall the sound is unacceptably inaccurate, and not even especially pleasant, over a wide variety of source material.\\n\\nComfort is not good, either. The headphones are way too tight and give an instant headache. The top bar is not padded on the underside and feels like a hard object pressing into the top of your head, which is exactly what it is. THe headphones are also hot. I couldn't imagine using these over the course of a multi-hour performance. I will say that the acoustic isolation is excellent.\\n\\nThe headphones are supplied with a coiled cord that extends nicely, and a quarter inch adapter for the eighth inch plug.\\n\\nBut for the price, would you really expect to get good studio monitor headphones?

I don\\'t get it many of the other screens are brightly colored and well designed, plus easy to read. This is a watch after all so shouldn\\'t the watch part be better. Unfortunately, unlike some other iWatches, you cannot change the primary watch face graphic. That said there are a number of other things that make this worth owning. You have a typical pulse rate monitor, and a blood pressure checker, this is enough for some medically centered smart watches. It however, adds value with some more unusual functions. Although one is dependent on the cell phone app link to use. ECG, (electro cardiogram) is a feature that tracks the pulse rhythm to see if the heart is beating properly and efficiently. To take you need to either tighten the band up or push down on the watch face to maintain contact till the test finishes. In the app it draws a charted graph much like you get at a doctors office and gives an analysis of the wave recorded. It seemed pretty good, but I\\'m not sure this is medical grade, but it maybe be close. Another nice feature is the blood Oxygen monitor. I have one for my finger, and this is close, the sensor array is good to take quick readings. The sleep monitor is a bit off I think, I have a BiPAP machine which gives more accurate results and this seems way off.

Some of the features are poorly interfaced in the cell phone APP, I was able to use them a bit more as I kept experimenting with them. A better manual would be nice, although as these things go this maybe better than most. Very inexpensive with all the medical and sports driven devices.

The device is very elegant, stylish, I like the feel of the buttons, the size of the screen, and the feel of the vibrating alerts-subtle but attention-grabbing at the same time. The screen has a really vibrant and responsive touch panel. Apart from physical appearance, it has additional functionality, but it is very easy to use.\\nI prefer not to have my phone next to me so I was able to set up only the important messages to come through when I am busy Quite impressed with this smart watch, especially with the size if the dial (4.3 cm), as well the clarity of the watch screen. With a larger dial you can reach a fair bit of the notification messages and get the caller info on the dial.\\nThe accuracy rate was on point! The heart rate monitor matched up to the treadmill as well as the distance and calories burned. The simplicity of your stats on the screen are fantastic. One of the main features that I appreciate about my new watch is tracking steps, calories, mileage, and hours of sleep. I am a pretty active person, I enjoyed my watch on a hike. Does great tracking steps. Heart rate control is also a feature that is helpful during exercise or during moments that I might feel anxious or overwhelmed.\\nI am really enjoying my new watch! Honestly at $40 this one, which is waterproof, is a clear winner and I LOVE it even more. Waterproofness is 100 percent. For money great watch. Control of music is a great feature, which allows me to stop the music while I cannot find my phone. Another favorite feature is being able to find my phone around with my watch. It was package well upon arrival.\\nOverall, it's pretty fancy for the price. There is nothing you can complain about the price point on this watch if you are on a budget. The price is very affordable and color options allow you to style it easily. The build quality is really spot on, with the aluminum housing and nice rubber-like watch band.

       " 'Updating (and upping star rating) after trying a few other “cheap fitness smart watches” and here’s why:\\n1. The squared off edges of the bezel better match the iPhone 12 style and looks more refined than the rounded black edges of many competitors.\\n2 Notifications seem to turn off if you shake the watch too much, I just turned it back on in the settings on the watch itself and I haven’t had a problem since. That might have been user error.\\n3. This watch allows you to delete messages, many other don’t! Who wants old messages floating around on their watch?\\n4. Had trouble with other brands not saving settings (imperial vs metric, Fahrenheit vs Celsius). I have not had any problems with this app, PubuFit, even though the app looks exactly like the other apps (HerobandIII).\\n5. I’m tall and this app lets me input my stride length to more accurately count steps!\\n6. More faces than most others so even tho not custom, can manage to find ones that work.\\n7. I mentioned the charger as a plus but after trying others with a small plug like attachment that falls off if you move it, this one is far superior. It stays attached! Full charge from 8% to 100% in 3 hours.\\n8. Swapping out with a quick change 20mm slim style band has made all the difference for me with my small 6” wrist.\\n9. If the BP & sleep readings were closer to accurate I’d give it 5 stars. They are “fun” to look at but nowhere near reality.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\nPurchased to use for blood pressure reading and message notification. Neither work. I emailed company and they agreed that the BP isn’t accurate and no way to calibrate it. The watch no longer buzzes when I get phone notifications, so the two reasons for purchasing are useless. Still on same charge 4 days in.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Wide variety of faces\\n-Fits comfortably on my small wrist\\n-Quick release bands can be swapped out\\n-Nice charger and connection\\n-Holds battery for a long time\\n\\nCons:\\n-Buzz for notifications stopped working\\n-Sleep does not detect when I am awake at night (even getting up to go to the bathroom and moving registers as light sleep)\\n-Blood pressure readings so far from accurate they aren’t even a guide\\n-Faces are not customizable\\n\\nIf you want a cute led watch then this works. Other than that not so much. I need to get something better.\\nRead more',\n",
       " \"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n This watch is priced really well with a feature set that rivals other more expensive big name brand models.\\n\\nReally nice metal construction and stable on-watch software.\\nMy favorite features: the sun up/sun down times with the in depth weather details and the 'find my phone' feature. I'm a photographer so sun up/sun down is really important, and I'm constantly losing my phone in my truck or in my couch cushions. Really nice to be able to press a button on the watch and have the phone ring. The music remote will be really nice for working out so I don't have to screw with my phone at all.\\n\\nThe watch has a nice full circle screen, so it's not squared off like other watches tend to be.\\nIt's pretty durable -- I've been wearing it over the last week or so and there's no scratches on the screen or bezel which is a miracle for me. I haven't tested the waterproof qualities because I like it too much to risk it. It's held up well to sweat and yard work though.\\n\\nThe pedometer doesn't seem to be extremely accurate, but the instructions specifically mention how you can calibrate that, I just haven't done it yet.\\n\\nThe app seems to be pretty on par with what you could expect from fitbit or similar fitness watch companies, just less ads and spam built in. Haven't had to do too much with the app yet, but it contains some settings for the watch.\\n\\nBattery life seems to be about 3-4 days but I've been charging it before it dies. Takes an hour or less, so I just charge it while I'm doing work on my computer.\\n\\nI really love how this thing looks. Very classy, and the weight from the metal housing makes it feel like a high quality watch. Very impressed, and I'd expect them to raise the price very soon on these as they grow in popularity. I'd absolutely buy another model from them in the future as this technology becomes cheaper to produce.\\n\\nMy only criticism is the slight wonkiness of the message notifications which might even get fixed with a firmware update at some point. It just doesn't integrate well with my 3rd party SMS app, but that's not a huge deal. I tend to get a buzz on the watch whenever I get some kind of call or message, so it's overall not too much of a detractor for me.\\n\\nI was considering a galaxy watch, but there's seriously no need to spend that much now that I have this thing. A lot of people would probably think it's really expensive if they held it or had a chance to inspect it.\\nRead more\",\n",

       " 'I bought this smartwatch because I needed something simple at an affordable price. I have found this watch amazing, and it is doing all that I need:\\n\\nHere some features that I found helpful\\n\\n1.- You can control the music on your phone from your watch. You can turn the volume up and down, stop and play the music and push forward or back. You cannot see which music is playing.\\n2.-The phone vibrates when there is an income call or message. You can see the message, but it is hard to scroll up and down to read. Sometimes it gets a little bit stuck. But that\\'s ok for me. I just need to be notified that I have a message and who sent it. The rest I can do it from my phone. You cannot reply back from your watch.\\n3.- It has an alarm that you set up in the app you install on your phone. I prefer to wake up with my watch vibrating than listening to the annoying sound of an alarm clock.\\n4.- It counts your steps and calories burned.\\n5.- It has a bunch of options for sports. After selecting the sport of your preference, it counts the calories burned, bpm, and active time.\\n6.- It has a timer\\n7.- it measures your heart rate, and it seems pretty accurate.\\n8.-It can track your sleep and tells you if you had a deep sleep or a light sleep. This function was hard to find because there is not such a thing as a \"sleep tracker\" in the watch. The sleep function is installed in the phone by default, and you find it by pressing the tab \"sports\" in the app and then pressing \"Healthy.\" It took me two days playing with the app to figure it out.\\n9.- Battery life says that last seven days. I have been using this watch for three days in a row, and today it still has around 70%, so I guess it will last until day 7.\\n10.- It says it is water-resistant, but I prefer not to mess with that, and I don\\'t think I will put it underwater, so I take it off when showering\\n11.- The smartwatch is very light and comfortable. It brings two watch straps, one for extra-large wrists. I have a petit wrist, so I use the regular watch strap in the penultimate hole, and it fits perfectly.\\n\\nOverall is a good smartwatch for the value. It is simple. You don\\'t need more.\\nRead more',\n",

Done on the app. Customizing things? App. Setting alarms and whatnot? App.\\n\\nWhile this isn't necessarily the most inconvenient thing in the world, it does show exactly how they made the watch so affordable. The app is free, however.\\n\\nTo it's credit, it's battery life is stellar, and it does fit comfortably.

I love that this one has 18 different activities, even some specific ones like climbing. The watch has really clear and easy to use face and menus. The home screen shows the time and all my stats for the day like calories, steps and current heart rate. By swiping from right to left or vice versa on the home screen, I cycle through 2 sub-menus. The first menu has various utilities like checking messages, heart rate, using a timer, etc. The second menu has the different exercise options. Swiping from the bottom of the screen shows graphical data of my statistics throughout the day which is really cool. A long touch on the screen and then swiping from left to right accesses menus to customize the watch face. The watch can of course be paired to my phone to access the ability to display messages and incoming calls.

       " 'I wanted a good way to get started in higher end cameras from the point and shoot ones, but not yet ready to drop $1500+ on a new pro camera yet. I decided to get this one after reading a number of reviews and looking through several reviews and other similar kits. This one had a good starter kit, but still not knowing how to set aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc (I only used auto-mode) , I was looking forward to getting a real-camera. I really wanted to be able to take hi-res beautiful pics and enjoy my new hobby.\\nSome comments on the kit itself. First the bad (and why it didn\\'t get 5 stars):\\n1) I really liked the camera body, the T7 (1500D in some regions, 2000D in others, but otherwise the same camera known by 3 different model numbers), but what I didn\\'t know, was the hot-shoe is missing the center pin. Canon decided to remove the center trigger pin so that you had to buy their flash. After tons of research, you can get a Godox trigger model X2T-C TTL and get the normal hot-shoe mount for flashes, plus it is wireless so you can use other compatible flashes. I\\'m not spending $300-400 on a Canon flash when there are plenty of good ones out there that work just fine, especially for a beginner rig like this. $300 would be a different story if I was spending $1500 on a camera body like a Mark series.\\n2) The tripod with this kit is a joke. It extends quite a bit, but it\\'s unstable. Put your $500 camera on it and unless you keep an eye on it, the tripod will topple eventually. I was fine with mine, but if the wind blew, you\\'re screwed. It\\'s a good beginner one, but if you\\'re reading this, get a good medium grade one. I would not advise relying on it. I tried to mount my camera with the legs not extended to take a macro picture. As soon as you tilt down at 45 degrees, the tripod won\\'t hold up the camera and wants to fall over. BEWARE.\\n3) The flash that comes with this is very simple. They don\\'t tell you until you begin to use it: This flash is designed to be a secondary slave flash. There is no way to trigger it with the T7 being sold with this rig. The T7 is a good camera, but I\\'m planning to get a Godox trigger and flash to go with the trigger. I do like the flash slave bar mount that comes with this, but there are better out there. The built in flash is good, but has limited range.\\n4) The description shows you get a FLD filter. Not knowing what this was, I didn\\'t know it mattered. THIS KIT DOES NOT COME WITH A FLD FILTER. The FLD filter is intended to filter for the color change that occurs with indoor florescent lights. The T7 compensates for this anyway. The filters you get are Vivitar (a good economy brand of lens and filter) and are CPL (polarizing for neutralizing reflections, allowing you capture clear water pictures for example), a UV filter (recommended to have for outdoor pics-but many lenses have a UV coating on them already-and as cheap as these are it can be used as a protection for your front lens glass-recommended by Chris Bray and they are cheap so why not), and a ND8 filter (neutral density-more valuable than an FLD filter). The lack of FLD filter was more of an annoyance for me, but filters are generally cheap to buy so I\\'ll just get one, the ND was a nice touch to have.\\n\\nNow for the good:\\n1) The camera case was a good starter, but it\\'s hard to put all the items in the bag. I am in the process of ordering a backpack to store my items in it.\\n2) This kit comes with 1 lens, and good general starter lens that goes from 18mm (portraits) to the beginning of telephoto range (50mm) at 55mm. Having tried a USM focus lens (ultrasonic-said to be fast) it sounds like mice or rats are in your lens chattering away. My STM (stepper motor) is quick and quiet. I prefer it over the cheaper quality USM.\\n3) Some of the other accessories that came like the 2x 32GB Sandisk memory cards (a good brand as opposed to the cheaper (quality in doubt) starter accessories that came with the kit from the seller, it worked well.\\n4) The extra battery and mini-charger (plugs into the wall or in the car) was a nice touch also. I\\'m going to invest in an external power connection for studio operation. That goes with getting flash and diffusers.\\n\\nIn hindsight, although I\\'m a prime member and used to getting my items within 1-2 days, this took 10 days to arrive, I presume due to stock being out, but when I ordered, it said in stock. I would have ordered one that included a telephoto lens for shooting my daughter\\'s sports events for an extra $100-150. There are tons of lenses out there and the choices are hard. My next buying plans are to get a telephoto lens like a 70-300 or 55-250 STM and a longer telephoto lens to shoot moon and stars pics. Some of these are in the thousands but lower cost \"ok\" lenses are under $300 so I\\'m going to try that.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a newbie and looking to start with this kit, I\\'d recommend a few things to you:\\n1) look for a good external flash, the one that comes with this is very basic and doesn\\'t work well\\n2) Get a good tripod, the tripod that comes with this kit is junk.\\n3) Stop using Auto Mode. Instead, take a youtube photography course. Chris Bray is one of the pros (uses Canon equipment) and does a good one in 10 parts (all about 15-20 minutes long each) or a longer single marathon one. After each section (10 total), I went outside and took some GREAT pics. My wife\\'s okra plant was blooming and I got a great pro-quality pic in my second day of owning this T7. I have not been happier. I\\'m not getting any benefit mentioning his course, there are other good ones, but his teaching was easy for me to understand and it helped me get up to speed quickly. I\\'m no longer afraid of exposure, ISO, or aperture settings, or shutter speeds. He also has good tips on how to get photos in low-light and recommended setups. I\\'m sure others do the same thing.\\n4) Get a good bag/pack for storing your accessories, you\\'re going to need it down the road.\\nmade.\\n5) Register the camera at Canon, and download the software (both free), and get the PDF manuals. They are a long read, but a good follow up after watching the youtube video courses above.\\n6) Get a data cable. Moving the card over is good enough, but if you are going to update the firmware or use the software to control the camera, you will need to get a Canon data cable.\\n7) The neck strap was ok, but I\\'d prefer a good hand strap that mounts on the side. Altura makes a good one, I see pros using it and after I mounted one (about $25) I will never go back to using a touristy neck strap.\\n8) The stock eye cup for the viewfinder (yes the real way you take photos-stop using the screen unless you need it for specific purposes), wasn\\'t great. I found some on Amazon for less than $10 and they are much better at sealing out the light and making it easier to see the image in the viewfinder. It\\'s easy to slide up and out of the way, and slide in a new one.\\n\\nBottom line, to get started, I\\'d still recommend someone buy a kit like this, just be aware you will need to get some quality items that counter some of the items that come in here. To get started, it\\'s a good basic kit, this gets you going, I just wished the tripod and some other accessories weren\\'t so cheaply made.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I am a believer of reviewing things I buy here on Amazon for others to read, because I use the same research from verified buyers, this is the longest review I\\'ve written to date, I hope it is helpful for you.\\nRead more',\n",

Amazon has other options there that you can use if you think that a tripod is really necessary in your kit.\\n\\nBasically I was checking for this camera in my country (Costa Rica) and just for the camera you will be paying around $575 we are talking of a total $600\\n$575 the camera\\n$20 bag\\n$20 extra battery and charger\\n$25 extra lenses\\n$35 SD cards\\n\\nWe\\'re are talking that just with that will be around $675.\\n\\nAnd I paid for this $483.85 including taxes, 2 day delivery.\\nArrived earlier, everything well packaged and safe! I bought this basically for moving my pictures from the quality of my cellphone to something more \"pro\" so if you are a beginner like me this will be amazing and super exciting.

My iPhone camera was actually not bad for day-to-day photos but it took HORRIBLE night shots. The moon, for example, was always nothing more than a blurry blob no matter how still I stayed.

Whether I have the flash on or not, the picture quality I get is absolutely amazing. I thought I was going to have to spend a fortune with the quality I get but not with this camera. Plus, the playback when doing video is just as clear as if I was there. You can definitely take selfies with this camera as you're able to see yourself and make sure everyone is in the picture.

Anyone with basic knowledge of a computer could have this set up and put to work in 20 minutes. The bulk of my printing falls into 2 categories- school work and crafting. For school work, a simple color printer gets the job done for producing nice documents and occasional image printing. For crafting, I need a higher quality image, accurate CMYK/color matching, and a high dpi for crisp output. I also require that it can handle sublimation ink for my heat transfer crafts. Well, folks, I am here to tell you that the OfficeJet Pro 9025 delivers all of that and more. After a quick set up and connecting to my computer wirelessly, I did a couple of test prints (see pictures). The color match was spot on. The images were crisp and clear, giving me a photo that was frame-worthy. I would feel as confident printing my personal pictures and crafting images as I would mass printing professional looking flyers for work. I also need to not that the printer is not loud. That's a small peeve, but something that will make me write off a printer. I dont want to hear the screeches or beeps, feel my desk shake as it prints, etc. This printer is quiet, fast, and really performs. Another plus is that it is InstantInk ready. Who hasn't gone to print and realized their cartridge is at the end of its lifespan?! This printer will communicate with InstantInk and based on your chosen subscription, will order your refills as needed! Don't forget that aside from printing, this is a scanner, copier, and fax. It maintains image integrity and produces a fantastic duplication of your documents via copy and scan. There isn't really an area of expertise that this printer doesn't hit the ball out of the park. This is a solid 10/10, highly recommend. It is a behemoth worthy of business use that is just as great for home office use. The price is on point and the quality far exceeds expectations! \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"This is my second HP all in one wireless printer that allows you to connect using their HP Smart app to do a plethora of printing.\\n\\nI had to admit this is bigger than I thought it would be, but that is my own person 'duh' because it is designed for small business and not just a personal printer. It has two trays that together can hold an entire ream of paper.\\n\\nIt has a digital screen panel control that help accomplish tasks anywhere from the initial set up to scanning, printing and making cool brochures.\\n\\nYou can connect via wifi using your router network, a connection to the computer with its own direct connection, USb or bluetooth.\\n\\nI have it connected to my wifi router. And , as was true with my other HP wireless printer, this caused some small issues with maintaining connectivity. It might just be the way my ISP and router is set, but I had to go in an give the printer a static IP address because some of the devices in my house (we have 4 computers, 4 phones and a tablet) had trouble discovering the printer based on the home network name, but easily found it based on the IP address. If the IP address changed (which they do in this case because of the way DHCP leases are set up in my home router) then those devices sometimes thought the printer was not online.\\n\\nIt is fast, the print is crisp and clean and I love using the app to print documents from anywhere.\\n\\nOne other thing to mention, the initial set up takes you through a lot of the HP marketing stuff which can be declined. One that seems really attractive is the Instant Ink program. This is a great option, initally, as you can get ink replacement at a deep discount. You set up your account through HP, set up how much ink you think you'll use in a month (this can be adjusted later if you find you use less or more), this will be used to set a recurring, monthly charge from your credit card/bank account. HP can tell when you are getting low on ink and will automatically send you ink before you run out. As mentioned this is offered at a pretty nice discount over buying replacement cartridges in a store. It is a great option if you plan on using and keeping this printer for any length of time. One caveat, if you replace the printer or cancel your instant ink enrollment, the instant ink cartridges will no longer work in your printer as of your effective cancel date. Even if they are already installed in the printer, even if you have some stock piled ready to be installed, yes even the ones already paid for. So for this printer, I declined the instant ink enrollment, since even with the discount I lost money from the last printer I had. I just didn't print enough (even though I was in the lowest possible enrollment tier).\\nRead more\",\n",

Then comes the sticker shock as you find out that the ink cartridges cost almost as much as the printer.

It is easier, and cheaper, to refill the ink this way.\\n\\nThe Epson EcoTank ET-2720 Wireless Color All-in-One Supertank Printer with Scanner and Copier - White is a very nice mid-range printer. You won\\'t use it to print giclee art prints or stunning sunset photos, but it will handle almost anything that the average user can throw at it with ease. Printing speed is fine, not the fastest ever, but also not slow enough that you notice it. I never once felt it was printing too slow or that I was having to wait too long for my project. It can do about 5ppm color and twice that speed in black and white.\\n\\nEpson has several models of the EcoTank printer series and if you want museum quality prints, they make a printer for that too. The ET-2720 is aimed squarely at the family of 4-6 with kids in school, maybe a mom or dad who prints reports for work, and the occasional picture from your phone or tablet. And it does a great job of doing that.\\n\\nWifi was relatively easy to set up, and this printer is basically a breeze. Filling the ink is easy and kind of fun!

       " 'I am not complaining this printer is bad but there are couple of things you should know before you purchase it.\\nIt is the best one we ever had and the cheapest ink tank printer among Epson printer lines but I figured out couple of things I should have known. I just want to share my experiences.\\n\\nFirst, WiFi antenna is not that good. Thankfully it comes with USB ports. so use USB instead. USB cable not included though. I think all Epson printers have the same issue.\\n\\nSecond, Ink tank quickly drains than you expected. even while it\\'s cleaning ink head you can see the ink gauge is decreasing quite rapidly. So, you should keep an extra replacement ink bottle. however you could see the ink bottle is all sold out from amazon. now you know why.\\n\\nThird. Paper is top loading. this printer is quite compact. width is just a little longer than 11\" letter size paper. (14.8\") but you see the depth is 22.8\" which is longer than the width. because this is the top loading printer, you will need way more space than what it says(I mean more than 22.8\"). otherwise you will easily have some paper jam.\\n\\nAh one more thing. You must to do paper alignment before you use it!!! if you don\\'t do this you will see white lines on your printing. When you install the printer it will guide you to do it. just follow the direction then you will be fine.\\nRead more',\n",

It's not perfect, but I think it's worth it.\\n\\nMost people want to hear the bad news first, so let's get that outta the way. The paper capacity is really small, for plain copy paper no more than 30 sheets. And here's how you load the paper. Flip open the narrow feeder guard from the rear of the top of the machine. Then slide the edges out. Take a look at the 5th product photo to see what it looks like with the feeder guard out.\\n\\nIf you're a glutton for bad news, hear this. The stated printing speed for color is 5 ppm, and for black is 10.5 ppm. This isn't the best all-in-one for those with 100 page print jobs, in my opinion. Now let's offset this with good news.\\n\\n* You get started with lots of ink. For the average home, it'll be a long time before ordering more ink.\\n* The ink is easy and safe to load. And it feels wonderful to be cartridge-free.\\n* Print quality is excellent to say the least, with highly legible text that's appropriate for most businesses and personal use. Also, its color photo quality printing is superior to laser jet printers at anything like the same cost.\\n* Long-term cost is widely variable depending on many factors such as humidity, and it's far superior to any printer that uses cartridges.\\n* The control panel is intuitive whether one controls the device there or on a phone or computer, and easy to use, in my view.\\n* This printer is well-documented with a 220-page user manual that's available as PDF online. This user manual is written in correct and plain language, demonstrating quality editing that's expected from Epson or any of its peers.\\n* Originated (whatever that really means) in Philippines.\\n\\nI believe this color all-in-one printer is a very good choice for a home printer that everybody at home can learn to use. Epson concentrates its strength and targets this market segment, those who want a reservoir, or supertank, printer for a couple hundred dollars. It certainly beats any cartridge printer, in my opinion. It certainly beats printer models that use subscription services for ink cartridges, which I consider to be a bad deal for subscribers.\\n\\nIt's better to go with a reservoir (aka, supertank) printer for economics and because they're greener than using cartridges.

If you’re like me who doesn't print or scan much but still would like to have a machine on hand when needed, this will work just fine. As for looks, the design is clean and even nice to look at. The power supply is integrated inside so theres no bulky “power brick” attached to the power cable to clutter up the floor. There is also a USB cable option in case you don’t want to use a wireless connection.\\n\\nUnlike other multifunction printers, the scanner uses a feeding mechanism instead of a flatbed. I was a little wary of this at first but it scans or copies with good quality. it accepts various sizes of documents from full-size 8.5x11” to smaller pieces of paper like receipts or photographs. Considering it uses rollers to feed the document I’d exercise caution with brittle or fragile paper like old family photos.\\n\\nPrint speed is about “average”. Color on regular settings on plain paper will take about 10-20 seconds and black and white about half of those times. Regular black and white text documents will print quickly. Higher quality photo settings with color are the slowest. Id recommend a better printer if you're looking for faster and frequent photo printing.\\n\\nThe ink cartridges are small so this is definitely not a high capacity printer. As i stated earlier, if you infrequently print from time to time this will be sufficient. If you’re really worried about needing more ink HP sells high capacity cartridges.\\n\\nThe wireless has worked flawlessly and was easy to set up. Ive found printing directly from my iPhone is SLOW.

Please read on, you will be glad you did, hopefully.\\n\\nWent from an HP OfficeJet 5740 all-in-one that was five years old, and this 8035e all-in-one bests that one by a decent margin in every category. Had to laugh at a couple of comments here, as one guy complained about how much the cartridges cost as he obviously turned down the one year\\'s free ink from HP\\'s Instant Ink included with the 8035e and bought his ink at retail. (I was also skeptical of his post since the 8035e comes with a full set of cartridges--which he didn\\'t mention.) With our 5740 we\\'d been on the Instant Ink program for 3-4 years now--the 100 pages for $4.99 a month with up to 300 roll-over pages you accumulate when you use less than your 100-pages per month allotment (only $60 a year.)\\n\\nJust plug the printer into your home computer network switcher that also connects to the Internet--I don\\'t bother with wireless as I much prefer wired as it is both more reliable and secure as it is immune to interference and much faster, too (when you plug into the printer\\'s Ethernet jack the printer\\'s wireless mode is automatically turned off)--and the Instant Ink program at HP reads your printer and measures your ink supply and actually sends out your replacement cartridges *before you run out of ink*. HP says the Instant Ink program saves ~50% over the cost of retail cartridges and I can easily believe it as I bought retail Ink cartridges for a year before I wised up and moved to HP Instant Ink for the next 3-4 years. Great thing is if you don\\'t want to keep the program HP will cancel it for you at any time without penalty--which is what happened when I pulled the 5740 off of Instant Ink and put the 8035e on in its place.\\n\\nI\\'ve used Inkjets since 1986--lots of different brands--and nothing I\\'ve ever seen beats this Instant Ink deal! Nothing even comes close--used to spend a lot more money on ink than I do now. If you take advantage of the program you can save enough to pay for your printer over time, easily. With the 8035e it\\'s really a no-brainer, because HP gives you 12 full months free! So if you don\\'t believe me, you really need to try the program. It\\'s really liberating not to have to worry about buying print cartridges at retail somewhere! Additionally, with the 5740 HP sent only their XL (extra-large) cartridges! I don\\'t know about the 8035e, as to whether that one will also use XL cartridges, but I\\'m using the cartridges that came with the printer and Instant Ink has already sent me my first replacements--which I will use when these run dry. Should be getting them any day now.\\n\\nOne last thing about Instant Ink--the page count--doesn\\'t matter to HP whether you print 100 full-color pages per month (or more with roll-over) or 100 pages of text! Or any mixture thereof. And color printing full pages uses up a ton of ink very quickly! That\\'s why I love the Instant Ink program.\\n\\nI also simply didn\\'t understand the lady who said the 8035e was \"too expensive.\" I\\'m sorry, ma\\'am, but $199 for an all-in-one that prints, scans, copies and faxes, comes with a year\\'s supply of free ink, too, and a 2-year factory warranty, is simply not \"too expensive\" in my book. The poor woman sounded like she would have been better off with a $40 color printer, unfortunately. And she said it was too complex to operate? Doesn\\'t get any easier than with HP Smart, which is the only printer control software I use and it is so simple to operate, in my opinion. So I can\\'t agree with that assessment anyway.

Interestingly enough the printer fits in exactly the same shelf space as my old Officejet 5740 fit into.\\n\\nAnyway--that\\'s my assessment of this printer for what it\\'s worth.

I bought this Canon printer with some reservation but so far my experience has been very positive.\\n\\nThe printing quality when using the TR8620 at default settings looks pretty good. Black text printing looks sharp and the black color looks, well, black. Not reddish black or watered down black but true black (as you would expect). Color printing is also pretty good with some slight grainy-ness at default settings (using plain paper though).\\n\\nI like that the printer asked for permission to \"call home\". I\\'ve grown wary of printers reporting to their makers. If you want to be able to print with your cellphone you must give the printer permission to access the Internet and Canon\\'s related online communication services for the feature.\\n\\nI like that (so far) I can use 3rd party ink without the printer refusing to operate. Being able to choose what kind of ink to use, whether it is official or not, is important to me. I don\\'t know what counter measures Canon has put in place on the printer (if any) but being able to choose promotes a lot of goodwill.\\n\\nI like the touch panel\\'s size. It\\'s big enough to see and operate. The \"Scan to PC\" feature just works. I can begin scanning from the printer without having to do anything on the laptop. The printer guesses what format to use (PDF or JPG) when scanning documents or photos. Saves me the trouble of having to convert formats after scanning. If using the document feeder on top while scanning then the printer will automatically merge the scans into one PDF for you. All of this can be manually overridden should you need to.\\n\\nAs much as I liked the auto document feeder (ADF) attachment I did run into some trouble. One time after an hour or so of use the printer began complaining the ADF was jammed even though there was no paper jam. The computer also started giving \"cannot communicate to scanner\" error messages. After searching the Internet I found a support page at Canon\\'s website that said the ADF was susceptible to heat and high humidity. Although I can still use the flatbed side of the printer when this quirk happens, I was a little bummed out. Months later I learned (after trial and error) the printer sometimes has trouble re-connecting to the monitoring tool on my laptop after long periods of inactivity. Restarting one or both devices usually fixes it for me.\\n\\nAs other reviewers have said the plastic parts that make up the printer\\'s many trays feel kind of flimsy. It gives the impression that it could break easily. On the other hand the trays can be quickly tucked away when not in use.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning the printer\\'s initial setup requires an Internet connection. Canon designed the install process as a website that takes you through a series of short presentations. You can choose to see pictures or watch \"how to\" videos as you go through the motions. You can\\'t just jump to the \"Download Drivers\" section and be done with it. Truth to be told I felt impatient and just wanted to skip it all but I still found it helpful. I later learned there is a download link at Canon\\'s website but you have to search for it on your own.\\n\\nConfiguring Wi-Fi settings was automatic. At some point the installation program uses your laptop\\'s own Wi-Fi to connect directly to the printer and transfer your PC\\'s network settings to it. After this is completed the install program switches back your home network and you are done. It took me about 20-30 minutes to set it all up. Once the printer was on the network, adding it to other family member\\'s laptops was a piece of cake. Using Windows 10 own settings application all I had to do was click on the \"Add a printer or scanner\". Windows automatically found the printer and installed the necessary software.\\n\\nOther than the quirks regarding the ADF and plastic tray I am very pleased with this purchase. It does everything I need and it meets my expectations. Here\\'s hoping the printer will last for many years to come.\\nRead more',\n",

To reload paper you have to close the front display that pops out, manually close the exit paper tray, then open main paper tray to load paper. Also has a 2\" cover on the main paper tray that just sits on top of the tray apparently to block things from failing into it since it is under the exit paper tray. Seems like it could have been designed better.\\n2) With the instructions you receive in the box, there is nothing to tell you how to setup WIFI because WIFI is disabled when the printer comes. So the instructions you receive say to hook the printer up with an ethernet cable or printer cable (not included). Seems like in this day and age WIFI should be one of the first instructions in setting up a printer and not hidden.

But after downloading the “Canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY” app on my iPhone, I was able to install the printer quickly. Once recognized on my network, all my portable devices as well as the Win10 desktop were able to find the printer. Some notes: Leaving the printer in the “auto power” state will save ink. Duplex copy is not automatic; you need to manually flip & reinsert the original. Two-sided printing is automatic. The plastic doc feeder feels flimsy. Photo quality is very good; document printing is not quite as good as my old Canon IP3600. Wireless printing from all devices is reasonably fast and seamless. Scanner functions are pretty basic (compared to my Epson Perfection V600) but get the job done. The need to leave the front door up seems like a weird design decision. All in all, this printer will work for me.\\n\\nUPDATE: I’m still going to go with a 3-star rating but could bump it to 3 1/2 based on current usage. Once installed, the printer is quite stable and, despite my previous comment, the text printing is better than my old IP3600.

Any REMOTELY dark part of the screen acts as a mirror. For reference, the first picture is a darker scene in a tv show, with a PERFECT reflection of me and the windows. The second shows it with a more standard word open window, and the background picture of the moon during the lunar eclipse with the stars around it.... and of course a PERFECT reflection of the two windows in my office. The third shows that even with a bright background (word full screen) you STILL see the windows and my white teapot reflected clearly.

       " \"I saw that another purchaser had the issue with one of the screens having a yellowish tint. I have color calibrated both monitors with a Spyder 4 Pro. You cannot fix the tint issue by color profiling or adjusting settings. It has to do with the LEDs that were used. Subpar in my opinion as whiter LEDs are more expensive to manufacture.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n-They are light weight and have USB hubs built in.\\n-Come with ample connection ports for all types of cable and cables for daisy changing. No HDMI cables though.\\n-They are thin, clear and crisp.\\n-Practically borderless edges giving you almost seamless side by side viewing.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n-Not uniform in color even when calibrated from the factory and a 3rd party color meter.\\n-Menu/control buttons are hidden on the back with an onscreen display selector (horrible design). If you have to adjust a screen when mounted side by side as my image shows, it's not easy to access or toggle.\\n-Some vignetting around the edges.\\n-Build quality seems to be cheap with very flimsy bezels around the edges that seem to be taped on. Not very secure.\\n-USB hubs are on bottom (my Asus ProArt 24 is on the side). Easier to access, but wouldn't work in a side by side configuration.\\n\\nOverall I guess these aren't bad monitors for what they are and price, but the yellowish tint is pretty much a deal breaker for me. In fact I ordered another set to compare them. When I hooked them up they had brighter (whiter) LEDs but they were just as far off from each other. The spec sheets showed factors that weren't further apart. In fact one of them had a dead pixel (no good for me). Plus with the serial #'s being on the monitor and boxes, there's no way to just switch out one for the other. You have to do the set. I just decided to keep these and deal with the yellow as much as it pains me. I use the whiter one for proofing and try not to have the same color screen up, because I can definitely tell one is warmer.\\nRead more\",\n",

I went in search of reviews describing how to configure the monitor, but there are few out there. Then I had the idea to search for reviews of the 27\" version of this monitor, which led me to this insight: Uniformity is on by default in sRGB and leaving it on drops your contrast in half and disable brightness adjustment!

       " \"If I were to review the mount on its own, I'd give it a 5. It is sturdy, holds my 32 inch monitor, and does what it is supposed to so far. It has a pretty decent range of motion and is positioned exactly where I wanted it. I like that you can clamp this stand to a desk or even drill a hole and affix it that way using the included tools. It is slightly on the bulkier side compared to other mounts that I've seen, but it does feel very sturdy, and that's something you want when you're holding up a big monitor.\\n\\nIf you do use the clamp setup like I did, keep in mind you'll need at least 3 inches or so of actual desk length. I mention this because many desks have metal bars underneath them which might prevent you from mounting it directly to the desk depending on where they are.\\n\\nThe mount is decently easy to set up, but there are many included parts that you may find yourself left over with as I did. This is because the instructions are very minimal. You'll have to watch a few online videos to make sure that you've done everything correctly. Seems like it'd be very simple to include some updated and more detailed instructions!\",\n",
       " 'I am very happy with this EVEO monitor mount. Yes, you must have a VESA compatible monitor (VESA=Monitor with holes in the back) and it does say so in the description. So before you purchase, make sure your monitor is VESA compatible.\\n\\nI am using it with my 32\" 4K LG monitor and it basically gave me my desk back. So much room now. This monitor arm also allowed me to adjust the height of the monitor to my height. I made it so that I have to sit up straight, which is great for my lower back!\\n\\nInstructions are vague so just watch the installation video. The clamp is solid and attaches firmly to my desk. Nice finish. The cable organizer also keeps the cords away and everything looking neat. The setup is very intuitive and simple. I wish I purchased it sooner!',\n",
       " \"This monitor is definitely a good value. Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.\\n\\nAll in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"I've seen many other reviews saying this monitor does not tilt, but it in fact does. I'm guessing people didn't take a close enough look at the hinge mechanism in the base, which attaches to the main display and allows for backwards tilt of approximately 15 degrees. The monitor is very light, thin, has small bezels, and produces reasonably good colors. It doesn't have a vesa mount, but I knew that before purchasing it, and wasn't planning to mount it. For $89, it is a great value.\",\n",

Contacted Amazon, and they sent a replacement and I returned the original. Again, a few weeks of perfect operation. Then on the replacement unit, the power and menu buttons stopped working. The only way to turn on and off was to physically unplug the unit. Contacted Amazon again, and they referred me to the manufacturer. After several attempts, I finally got a hold of a person. They said they would look at, but I would have to ship it back on my own dime, and they would not replace it. I declined (mostly because I didn\\'t have a box to pack it in, and was severely unimpressed with customer service).\\n\\nSo I continued using it for several months with few issues. I stopped using it earlier this year, mostly because I got tired of the physical unplugging, and started using an old TV instead. Just now, went to fire it up again for my wife to use.

       " 'This HP 24mh monitor has a clear, crisp display and is the perfect size for desktop use (not too big, not too small). It accepts both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs (and even VGA for old school PCs). While Windows will select 60Hz refresh rate by default, you can go into Windows\\' display settings and select 75Hz refresh rate for this monitor. The 75Hz refresh rate really does help smooth out motion. You should also go into the monitor\\'s \"Image\" menu setting and set Response Time to Level 3 which provides the best VSYNC performance. One of the best features that places this monitor above and beyond its price range is the 90-degree rotating screen, height adjustment, and swiveling base. The stand is rock-solid without any wobble. The speakers are just fine once you discover the menu control I explain below:\\n\\nHOW TO FIX LOW VOLUME SOUND: The built-in speakers are better than some reviewers indicate. I believe most people don\\'t discover that the monitor menu has its own volume control that\\'s set to 50% volume by factory default. If you just connect this monitor to the PC you\\'ll automatically get sound through the HP speakers via HDMI or DisplayPort (you only have to use the separate audio cable when using the VGA input). But no matter how high you turn up your PC volume control, you\\'ll only get 50% volume from the monitor\\'s speakers which is why people complain about low volume. To fix this, all you need to do is go to the \"Management\" tab of the monitor menu, select \"Audio\", and then turn up the volume control from 50 (default) to 100 and you\\'ll find the monitor speakers are plenty loud. After that, you\\'ll only have to use your PC volume control as normal.\\n\\nThis is a great quality monitor with features beyond its price range. Fantastic value, HP!\\n\\nADDITIONAL NOTE: HP sells an identical monitor to the HP 24mh under the model P24h. The only difference is that the P24h has a black plastic logo strip along the bottom instead of silver like the 24mh. Everything else is identical (specs, speakers, height adjustable stand, etc.) plus the P24h comes with both an HDMI cable and a DisplayPort cable.\\nRead more',\n",

       " 'TLDR:\\n\\nThankfully out of all the bad reviews I gambled and I got a good working monitor and it seems to be working as promised so far. The headphone jack is garbage but fortunately, it\\'s not a deal-breaker because the monitor sound is good. It\\'s really only 18\" and they may leave it at your door in the product box so all your neighbors and passerbys can see you bought a monitor. Read full review for details.\\n\\nSo I\\'ve been shopping around for a couple of weeks now trying to put together a decent little gaming computer and when I finally got around to shopping for the monitor... here\\'s this lovely monitor for only $88.... can\\'t be right. I click and read through the specs....this can\\'t be right. Then I look through the reviews... about 300/4000 (4/11/2020) reviews were 1 stars with sound issues, screen issues, power cord issues, one-and-done then never coming back on, and just plain crappy craftsmanship.\\n\\nThat being said... the numbers.... 300/4000 are what convinced me to at least give it a try... I mean for $88 bucks and with amazon return/refund policy the worst that would happen is that I get a dud and I just don\\'t repurchase the monitor and I find a better one. So I ordered it.\\n\\nPROS(ish)\\n\\nI received it today.. plugged it in... and held my breath as pressed the power button. IT LIVES! There\\'s one big complaint/ 1-star rating worry crushed.\\n\\nI hook it up to my laptop... I jump over to Youtube to test the sound... IT SINGS! Another hurdle/ 1-star rating worry crushed.\\n\\nI then unplug everything and properly set it up ( I didn\\'t set up the stand or other bits because I didn\\'t want to have to re-wrap and pack if I got a dud)... I set up the stand and place it on my desk with my other things and plug it up again... IT COMES BACK TO LIFE!\\n\\nI put in my copy of Avatar to test the 1080p they boast about for the monitor and IT LOOKS GORGEOUS!\\n\\nCONS\\n\\nSo now most of my biggest 1-star worries are crushed however there are 3 non-deal-breakers that I have with the monitor.\\n\\nIt has an audio jack for headphones but the sound is so grainy and there\\'s a lot of noise. I tried several different headphones and they all sound like garbage unless you turn it down to lower volume where you can\\'t hear the noise. SO while the sound from the monitor is great the sound for headphones is garbage.\\n\\nNext, 20\" they say? I don\\'t want to make a \"boys can measure joke\" but... it\\'s really only 18\"... so if you\\'re really looking for those extra 2\" they aren\\'t there.\\n\\nLastly, is a shipping issue... the box they ship it in is the product box, like fresh off the shelf at a store. Guys, you\\'re sending this to someones house/apartment?! Thankfully I was home when it was delivered and I got an email from Amazon letting me know my delivery was close by BUT what is I hadn\\'t been home? Someone could have easily seen exactly what I ordered and taken from my porch.

The post attaches to the base with a built-in screw that you tighten by hand, the other end of the post snaps into the back of the monitor while it’s still in the box, and then you simply remove it from the box and connect the cables.

It is not adjustable up and down, only tilts front to back so it needs to be matched in hit to, not adjusted to match another monitor. There are no VESA mounting holes on the back so it must sit on the desk.

       " \"I've had this projector for a couple days now and it has blown me away. I upgraded from an old optima hd20 because I wanted 4k hdr and this LG projector delivers both. As long as this projector gets the rated 30k hours usage, i'll be completely satisfied.\\n\\nSetup was quick enough, I used an existing ceiling mount from my old projector. When I first turned HU70LA on, it recognized it was upside down and flipped the image automatically, that was a nice touch. I'm projecting from about 15ft away onto a 133in screen and the image is plenty bright, even with some ambient light in the room things are still watchable. Something really noticeable, especially in HDR content is how vivid everything looks. The colors are really vibrant. The throw distance i'm using is about as far away from my screen as i can while not making the image too large for my screen. If you have a longer throw distance you are going to need a bigger screen. I did have to use the keystone alignment, it only adjusts vertically and not horizontally (but i only needed vertical keystone).\\n\\nLG's webOS is integrated just like their TV's. The magic remote is just that. Magic. I really like the motion control cursor and the smart features of the projector. I didn't think i would use them a lot, but it is just really convenient rather than turning on my xbox or apple tv. It is also really easy to have different image presets and swap between them (for example a gaming preset and then a movie preset) CEC works to turn on my receiver so with the one remote it is all I need if i'm streaming things from webOS. If you have used webOS on any of their recent tvs, no surprises here. its the same great experience.\\n\\nNormally i don't like the smooth motion image interpolation when watching tv or movies, but on a projector and screen this large i've become a quick fan. Everything about it just feels better. (Not for gaming though, only for video content consumption)\\n\\nBeing able to play pc games at 1080p and 120hz is pretty amazing. One of the reason i selected this model was for pc gaming on a big screen and not having to sacrifice high refresh rate is absolutely awesome. The input lag on game mode (while i'm not sure what it is) was not noticeable to me.\\n\\nMy only image complaint is the black levels aren't super great. They are decent, but when you go watch something darker like Batman the dark knight or Mr Robot, i found I had to turn up the brightness setting on the projector to actually see details in the dark. Doing this washes out the image a little bit, but it still is a great improvement over my old projector. I just made a preset for darker things and switch to it when needed.\\n\\nIt would also be nice if the power supply was internal so it used a normal plug to the projector from the wall rather than using a power brick, but i feel like that is really nitpicky. In my situation i just zip tied it to my ceiling projector mount arm and called it good. It isn't as clean as an install though as just plugging a cable directly from the outlet into the projector.\\n\\nAlso wanted to make a quick note, make sure that you get cables rated for 4k@60hz (18Gbps). I first tried with an old high speed cable that was only rated for 4k@24hz (10.2Gbps) and I couldn't push 4k content to the projector. Just keep cabling in mind when getting a projector like this.\\n\\nEDIT: After using this projector for a little over a month I tried to get the Disney+ app on it but it is not supported. This projector is running webos 3 instead of 4 (you need 4 for the more recent channels like disney+).

After even more testing I found that the black levels are... acceptable. It has good traits. It has bad traits. The good do outweigh the bad.\\n\\nIn short: if you intend to replace a TV with this projector, then by all means pick it up. I was sporting a 10ft screen (120\" diagonal) and at first glance, with some ambient light, I was very impressed. The color is truly excellent, as others have noted. It is so excellent it shines in bright ambient light, catching the eye and filling in the image. The color is what makes this LED projector shine (pun intended). It is lovely.\\n\\nThe problems begin when you lower the lights for a bit more clarity because... well, there isn\\'t any. The exact same image you saw with ambient light? That\\'s nearly what you are getting when the lights are low. There isn\\'t any extra dark hiding in the shadows. It\\'s going to be good color and only acceptable dark forever.\\n\\nIn its favor this projector sports 30,000 hours of lamp life. This is near-TV levels of lifespan for the light source, normally the trouble area for projectors. It touts being rainbow-effect free, though I oddly thought I caught some here or there. Did I mention it has magnificent color? It has LG\\'s WebOS built in and can capably stream many, many wonderful apps in full 4k (not Disney+ or Hulu at this time). It is light. It is svelt. It has the back-lit magic remote.\\n\\nBut, it has poor, poor black levels, requiring you to wash out the picture to bring them up in HDR (far better performance in SDR). It has decent, but not great, input lag for gaming (40+ ms for 4k, 50+ ms in SD). It isn\\'t the greatest optically (mine had minor focus uniformity issues). It isn\\'t truly all that bright, despite the incredible color brightness. Strangely, that will affect you more in the dark, it seemed to me, than in the daylight. Also, the brightness is more an issue with the desired size of my screen (120\"). At a smaller size the brightness may be far more tolerable.\\n\\nLike I said, it has good and bad traits. This projector is good. I preach the black levels, especially with HDR content. But, it is by no means the worst projector I have ever used.\\n\\n4 stars,\\nRead more',\n",

       " 'Tried this projector and unfortunately the original and replacement order were both damaged on delivery. Appeared to be some kind of manufacturing issue as the first one had broken parts rolling around inside the projector — the replacement had a giant cluster of dead pixels that ruined the surrounding beautifully displayed images. Thankfully Amazon customer service was the absolute best - they are hooking me up with the HU80KS model. Very happy now and still a LG fan.',\n",
       " 'I researched projectors for weeks before finally settling on this one. I went with it primarily because it was not only going to be used for movie watching, but also to replace our current television. So far, I’d have to say that this lives up to every expectation. Hopefully the bulb life is what they say it is. Great picture overall, easy setup, and a 120” projection from about 12-13 feet away. I think I made the right choice.',\n",
       " 'NOTE: I give it a 4-star review, but it\\'s actually 3.5/5\\n\\nI have wanted to get a projector since 2004. However, circumstances have kept me from biting the bullet. First, 1080p became a new thing, so projectors were WAY spendy for 1080p. Then, 3d came out. As I waited for those prices to drop, 4k got released. I didn\\'t care much about 4k until HDR came around. THEN, I was interested. Since then, I have been waiting for a price-to-performance window with very specific features. I finally decided to bite the bullet and go for the LG HU80-KA.\\n\\nThe Good Things:\\n1. Portable, great for on-the-go\\nThis projector is extremely light, and I like how everything is contained into a compact rectangle. The cord can be pulled into the projector, and you just lift up the handle and take it wherever you want to go. I plan to bring this with me to beach trips with friends, where we will barbecue and drink while movies are playing.\\n\\n2. Extremely quiet\\nI have this mounted about two feet behind my head. I can\\'t hear it at all, even with low volume audio while watching a movie.\\nI attempted to place it inside a shelf that allowed 4-5 inches of space around the projector. This caused the fans to go into overdrive. It still wasn’t all that loud. It’s comparable to a laptop running at high fan speed (which is essentially what the fans are).\\n\\n3. HD video (blu-ray) looks amazing\\nThis is a real stunner with a good quality blu-ray. I put in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and it was just plain spectacular. A good blu-ray will look really good from this projector.\\n\\n4. HDR color is very nice.\\nI’ll discuss more about my HDR misgivings next, but… I have no issues about the deep, rich color that beautifies UHD video sources. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is a perfect example. It’s like this projector and that movie were MFEO.\\n\\nThe Not-so-good Things:\\n1. HDR tone mapping can be good, or very not-good\\nWhen I first started playing 4k UHD/HDR titles, I was woefully unimpressed. The picture was way too dark, and color was flat and uninspired. But of course, it\\'s important to tweak your stuff. I have an OLED65C7 as well, and I never ever touch the \"Dynamic Contrast\" setting. It\\'s not needed. However, I have read/heard that the 2016 series LG OLED displays do a better job tone mapping the HDR data when \"Dynamic Contrast\" is turned on. I tried it with this projector, and BOOM - instant increase in quality!\\nI no longer thought \"Eh, Vivid Mode might be the best option - and Vivid Mode is something that I have never, ever, EVER preferred or used in all my years of having a display.\" Instead, I thought \"Wow, Cinema mode looks great. Technicolor mode is also nice, with a slightly yellowish golden hue that works for some movies, maybe not for others.\" Depending on the movie, I have a \"cooler\" presentation with Cinema, slightly darker/warmer settings for Cinema (User), and the Technicolor mode looks great for other movies.\\nNOTE: The HDR settings menus is separate from non-HDR video settings.\\nThe real stunner UHD presentations included Hacksaw Ridge; Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2; Spider-Man: Homecoming; and Blue Planet II.\\n\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" looked great during daytime shots, but I noticed heavy macroblocking and bloom during the sandstorm sequence. Flames looked terrible as well, but I don\\'t know if it was as bad, or worse looking, than on my OLED. They just plain look weird in HDR.\\nSo far (I will keep tweaking settings), I noticed that highlights suffer from noise, especially white backgrounds, and gradation jumps out at me on all fronts. I don\\'t like any of those \"noise reduction\" or \"movie optimizer\" or \"frame interpolation smoothiemoothie\" dongles. I am not fond of artifacting.\\nI watched several older movie remasters by Sony, such as Men in Black; Ghostbusters; Spider-man; and Spider-Man 2. I found the color to be slightly drained, when using the same settings used for the newer movies, but Technicolor was more pleasant with these titles. It really depends on what I\\'m watching for which mode I think looks best.\\nFor older movies especially, I found the HDR made highlights too overblown. An example is during Ghostbusters at around the 1hr 10min mark, when the GB team are being greeted by hundreds of bystanders before they head into the final showdown. The street has sunlight gleaming off the tarmac as they are driving in the Ecto-1, and it\\'s blown out and had notable macroblocking.\\n\\n2. Blacks are kind of milky\\nI have an OLED display. It would be unfair as heck to compare a mid-range projector on a white 1.1 gain screen to the blacks available on an OLED. Or the color reproduction. I found darker movies could sometimes make me yearn for the OLED, such as when I watched \"Logan\" (looks good most of the time); \"The Equalizer\" (it looks stable enough, but on the OLED it looks much, much better); or \"Men in Black 3\". Look, I\\'m not saying it\\'s unwatchable. I am just saying that, well... it\\'s not a $6000 Sony projector, nor a similarly-priced JVC or Epson. Also, I am sure costs were cut using the .47 DMD instead of the newer, bigger version. They sacrificed that, I’d wager, for laser projection and a compact design. However, I figure savvy engineering can muster better performance from the same chip that is used by other devices; I compare it to the way DAC chips can be deemed unimpressive, but in the hands of another engineer (think Schiit), it becomes magic.\\n\\nMy room is completely dark, with tan/beige walls.\\nI plan to get a grey fabric screen soon, and that might help push the blacks into a slightly darker realm. For now, it\\'s not \"terrible\". For most people it might not even be bad at all. I just happen to be very spoiled with my displays over the years to notice.\\n\\n3. Placement options are lame\\nThis has a 1.0 to 1.2 zoom capability. I have a 110 inch screen. I want to watch movies from 9-13 feet away. This means that I would have to sit really far behind the projector at the 1.0 distance if it\\'s in front of me. However, if I place the projector BEHIND me, then I need to set it 1-2 feet behind me, and I personally don\\'t have a ceiling mount. I live in an apartment, and I can\\'t drill holes. So, I have to place it on stands behind me to raise the projector. I do not want to use the auto-keystone feature, because 1) it reduces output quality (the more keystone smear, the worse it gets) and 2) it makes the display really, really tricky to tweak.\\n\\n4. No lens shift\\nWith a 1.0 to 1.2 zoom, it means that the projector will most likely be sitting in the middle of the exact spot that you want to be watching movies from.\\nIf you don\\'t mind sitting a couple feet to the right or left, that\\'s probably fine. But for center-brained people like me, it makes placement annoying. I either need to A) place it in front of me, and it obstructs my view, and I\\'m sitting farther back than I prefer; or B) it is directly BEHIND me, and I\\'m sitting at the distance I want... but I have to be far to the right or left of center. Unless it\\'s raised to the height of the TOP of the screen, but as previously mentioned, I can\\'t drill holes in my ceiling.\\nI think a lens shift option would have greatly alleviated this complaint.\\n\\nCONCLUSION (October 10 Update):\\nAfter two months of use, here are my \"final thoughts\".\\nSince this is my first projector purchase, I now have a better idea on what I want when I choose to upgrade in a couple/few years.\\n\\nLessons Learned:\\n\\n- Use a grey screen, or silver grey screen. I\\'m getting one when I buy a home theater projector in a couple/few years. In a completely dark room, it DOES make a difference in blacks and contrast levels!\\n- For \"ultimate video quality\", it doesn\\'t seem like laser bulbs can compete, unless you\\'re willing to dish out a LOT more dough for the technology. Depending on what\\'s available by 2021, I may opt for better video performance/quality instead of the great portability features of the LG HU80KA. Without a doubt, a $2500 regular bulb projector will stomp this $3000 projector in color reproduction and black levels. But, it doesn\\'t mean this model isn\\'t without its strong points!\\n- I still think LG\\'s HDR tone mapping needs some fixing up. I don\\'t know if any firmware update can fix it, or if LG even has the issue on their radar. If the 4k UHD movie has grain (think older movies), then the HDR algorithm goes poopy. I mentioned this already in my review, but I think adding Dynamic Contrast (to allow the HDR to \"pop\" the way it should) along with the projector\\'s method of converting the content causes issues. It\\'s still nice to look at, and I think most people will be less likely to notice. I am kind of a video quality freak. HDR with the LG HU80KA on grain-free movies is stellar!\\n\\nLG HU80KA; THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY:\\nDon\\'t be disappointed by the underpar performance compared to bulb projectors at this price range. There are things to like...\\n- It is light, and portable. I will use this for public gatherings, picnics, and to use while doing podcasts as a digital poster and/or to have motion posters when talking with guests (the mirror flipped up will be helpful for me ONLY in this circumstance haha). This means that I plan to be carrying it to many destinations. I can\\'t think of a projector with 4k (real or fake), HDR, decent light output, good wireless connections options, as well as a lightweight design in such a small package. The laser bulb helps lighten the load, and I like the longevity of the bulb life (as well as more consistent color and brightness performance over time).\\nTHAT is this projector\\'s greatest strength.\\n- If you want to permanently mount this, and will rely on it solely for dark room \"home theater\" use... it\\'s not worth it. I recommend scores of other options for $3000.\\n- If you like to watch broadcast television, live sports, and have low ambient light while friends are sitting around drinking and eating chips and dip... this will work out pretty nicely. ESPECIALLY if (once again) you want to move this thing around a lot! Otherwise, save some money and get a cheaper 1080p projector with 3000+ lumens ;)\\n\\nUPDATE (October 1, 2018) - Trying different screen fabric samples:\\nI purchased the Silver Ticket Products sample kit. There are different fabrics (9\"x11\") allowing the customer to test the differences between each of them. Below are my impressions:\\nGrey - Light Grey: I found that the light grey most definitely increases black levels, while maintaining almost the same amount of brightness. Additionally, I noticed that colors were VERY SLIGHTLY more \"poppy\" and saturated. However, color difference is negligible. Black levels are not; it is certainly an improvement.\\n\\nSilver - Silver Metallic: This fabric provides even deeper blacks, and colors are about the same as I found with the light grey material. I will do more testing soon, but out of all three fabrics, I found this one to be far and away the best option. This seems to sacrifice lumen output/brightness very slightly. However, in a completely dark room I don\\'t think the difference will be so drastic that most viewers would be upset with the change (I would guess it decreases brightness from 1400, down to ~1100 lumens).\\n\\nHigh Contrast - Dark Grey: The dark grey is very sensitive to variations in the flatness of the fabric (easily prone to \"hotspotting\"). I used Scotch tape to tape the back of the fabric. This caused bright spots where the tape was located on the back. With that said, I found the high contrast dark grey to be TOO dark.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the most pleasing visual marriage between the projector and fabric type the Silver Ticket Product\\'s \"Silver Metallic\" finish. However, a \"Light Grey\" finish is most definitely an improvement over my 1.1 gain white screen.\\nHope this helps!\\n\\nThank you for reading my long, LONG review. I hope some of the information contained has been helpful. Take care!\\nRead more',\n",
       " 'The LG HU80KA is one really peculiar projector for numerous reasons, so let\\'s start at the beginning:\\n\\nThe unboxing procedure couldn\\'t be any easier. Open box, grab the projector (by the handle!), pull it out, and plug it in.\\n\\nOK, fine - one more step.. Grab the remote as well, pop the included 2x AA batteries in the battery compartment, and away you go. That\\'s it. There\\'s no other parts or accessories. No lamps to replace, no filters to clean - nothing.\\n\\nSo, for starters, I brought this projector down into my cave. This is a dedicated movie space, with black walls, velvet treatments, and a Stewart StudioTek 100 115\" 16:9 screen. Currently I\\'m using a JVC DLA-RS540 as my main viewing projector, so I was reaaaaaally (and I mean reaaaaaally) interested to see how this new laser projector would stack up, despite being half the price of the JVC.\\n\\nFirst things, first - getting the image shining at my Stewart screen really couldn\\'t be easier when the device is standing upright. See, the LG\\'s pièce de résistance is that you can bring it anywhere, easily. Pick it up by its carry handle, plop it down on the floor, and use the included mirror flap to shine the image at your screen. No need to mount the thing or find a table to lay it on. Apparently there\\'s a 4% decrease in lumen output when using the mirror versus mounting the projector pointing at the screen, but if there is a difference in brightness - I couldn\\'t tell.\\n\\nThen, the power on. The power on procedure on my JVC projector is as follows:\\n\\n1.) Turn on projector with power button.\\n2.) Go get some coffee while it (a lamp-based projector) spends a few minutes warming up/brightening up.\\n\\nWith the LG?\\n\\n1.) Turn on projector with power button.\\n2.) Use projector just about immediately, at full brightness.\\n\\nLasers are awesome. Lasers! PEW-PEW!\\n\\nPicture:\\n\\nBut... lasers have issues. Much like JVC\\'s flagship laser projector, the DLA-RS4500, the LG HU80KA has a contrast deficiency compared to its lamp-based brethren. Don\\'t get me wrong, in no way am I comparing this LG to JVC\\'s big boy, but it\\'s a trait shared between the two - that if you DEMAND the best contrast over anything else, then lamp-based projectors are still where you should head.\\n\\nThe LG has three brightness settings - found under Energy Savings. The LG HU80KA\\'s blacks take on a grey-ish, milky look, that in my dedicated movie space are less than impressive, and that’s putting it mildly. Even with the energy savings set the highest level to decrease lumen output, I could never get the black levels where I wanted them to be. And with no dynamic iris of any sort, the LG just can\\'t cut it for absolute contrast. It’s worse than my old Sony VPL-HW50ES 1080p projector. Again, this is NOT a cave-movie-room projector at all.\\n\\nColor, though? Sharpness, though? Both are really, really excellent on the LG. Really punchy colors from this DLP setup, and - much like JVC\\'s setup (bar their laser model), - it also uses a form of pixel-shifting to achieve its 4K resolution. So no, it\\'s not native 4K, and no - I firmly believe this doesn\\'t matter. I used to be a naysayer of pixel-shifting, but for movie/TV-watching, it\\'s incredible. My other viewing environment is my LG C7 4K OLED, so resolution IS important, but pixel-shifters are phenomenal in this regard. That said, I noticed a slight sharpness deficiency in the top right corner of my screen using the LG standing up (with the mirror in use), but direct on the sharpness was excellent throughout. I only noticed on text, anyway, so for regular use it would never be an issue.\\n\\nSo the picture is good, - really good even - except for the middling contrast in a cave. In a living room or any room with a little ambient light, this contrast deficiency likely won\\'t even matter, and the brightness of this projector is really something. 2,500 lumens (uncalibrated, sure - but all manufacturers quote these numbers in this regard). It really packs a punch. In my living room, firing at a white wall at mid-day, the image was still perfectly watchable at minimum Energy Saving setting. At night, the image is TOO bright at this same setting.\\n\\n4K HDR looks fantastic. Planet Earth II on UHD pops, John Wick Chapter 2 is also impressive (raw black levels aside). 24p motion is also well taken care of, with LG’s usual TrueMotion settings allowing tweaking of things further.\\n\\nA quick mention of the DLP technology at play here: I’m usually pretty sensitive to “rainbows” with DLP projection. I won’t say the LG is completely free of the phenomenon, but I never noticed it in actual material, - just on white text when my eyes would flick between words. So, again, for movie/TV watching, - not an issue. Your mileage may vary here, but I’ve struggled with DLP rainbow in the past so I’m confident in saying it shouldn’t be an issue for most.\\n\\nLess impressive is the mirror mechanism. It’s a manual thing that you lift up and down, and once in position for a few seconds the projector will automatically keystone-adjust the image. Keystone adjustment is just… bad, in general. You never want to use it because it does distort the image somewhat - despite not always being obvious in the badness. However, in the case of a mirror design like this, there’s no real choice. The problem then becomes that the projector doesn’t always get its keystone adjustment quite right, so there can be a little distortion in terms of image shape, especially if your image is not projected very large. I found that when blasting an image around 65” diagonal and up that the keystone distortion was kept to a minimum (if not perfect). With the image smaller than that (unlikely for most people), the keystoning was more visible. Also, because the mirror is not electronic, it’s possible to have the image be not quite flat or aligned correctly just because the mirror isn’t sitting quite “right” when you adjust it. So I’ve on occasion had to just wiggle the mirror or move it up and down to the same position for it to sit “right” and look rectangular on the screen. It’s just not completely fool-proof, despite working reasonably well. You can also fully disable the keystone correction, thankfully, if you’re able to get your geometry just right (no easy task).\\n\\nAlong with no mechanical mirror adjustment, there’s also no mechanical zoom/focus adjustment. On the side of the projector there are two dials, one for zoom and one for focus. They’re quite stiff, and need a little finessing, but they do work. Also, when using the mirror the focus does change when adjusting the zoom, so this is something to bear in mind. You will always need to adjust zoom AND focus, even if the focus was perfect at one zoom level.\\n\\nSpeaking of zoom level, it’s a 1.0 - 1.2x zoom mechanism here, so there’s not much flexibility. This is NOT a short-throw projector, so if you want e.g. a 120” diagonal 16:9 image, you’ll need to place the projector a minimum of 11.4 feet away. There’s also absolutely no lens shift of any sort. Sitting the LG on the floor and using the mirror gives you image-up/down flexibility (at the cost of some keystone adjustment), but there’s no lateral shift available. The non-flexibility of placement comes at a cost here, which I’ll touch on more later.\\n\\nNoise levels:\\n\\nThe LG is extremely quiet (brilliantly so) with Maximum Energy Savings turned on, noticeably louder with that set to Medium, and louder still when set to Minimum. Noise is extremely subjective. I would say I’d prefer the unit to be quieter when set to full brightness, but it’s not an especially intrusive fan noise. The thing that may potentially be bothersome to some is the high-pitched sound that emanates from the unit when the laser is enabled (it seems to go away if you close the mirror - which shuts the laser engine off). I’m sensitive to high-pitched sounds, so this sort of thing is a tad bothersome. Whether you notice it will depends on a few factors:\\n\\n1.) How far you sit from the projector.\\n2.) The position you sit in relation to the projector.\\n\\nI found that moving to the left or right of the projector changed that sound dramatically, so your mileage may vary here. Overall, though, with any movie/TV sound playing, I found no real issue with the sound signature from the projector. Projectors just make noise, and that’s the way it is.\\n\\nFrom what I can tell, there are four fans, two on each side of the projector - that blow air in, and then out the other side.\\n\\nOh, and amusingly, when you turn the projector on, it absolutely sounds like there’s a little hard drive spinning up inside. No, I’ve got zero idea about this, either…\\n\\nSmart TV:\\n\\nMuch like my LG C7 OLED, this projector uses WebOS 3.5, which works great, - really smoothly, and with the same remote with mouse-like features that this TV has. I was able to get the projector connected to 5Ghz WiFi without issue, and downloaded YouTube, Netflix, and … wait a second, where’s Amazon Prime video!? I know I have Prime Video on my LG TV, so where is the app on this projector? Nowhere to be found, currently. This is a massive disappointment to me, and very odd. Hopefully LG adds Prime Video back in with a software update because it’s sorely missed. There were no updates available when I checked. Boo.\\n\\nThe YouTube app works just great, although - amusingly, it keeps pestering me to dictate my searches. The LG HU80KA remote has no such microphone functionality, though my LG C7 OLED does. Go figure. 4K HDR YouTube looks pretty great, as you’d imagine.\\n\\nSound:\\n\\nThe LG has stereo speakers inside itself. For a projector the sound is out of this world. But, temper your expectations a little. Despite being in a league of its own in terms of audio output, there’s some clipping of certain frequencies that are bothersome. Keeping the volume lower doesn’t seem to affect how often the audio clips, so it’s frequency dependent, not volume - when it clips. For the most part, though, the sound really is something special. There’s not really any bass to speak off, but it’s remarkable how FULL the sound is from a projector. Who’d have thought?\\n\\nIn my movie space, I paired the projector with my Denon AVR-X4300H receiver over Bluetooth, because in a living-room space this could be a VERY useful feature to avoid cabling. Unfortunately, no matter how much I tried, the audio was out of sync with the video by close to two seconds (!!). Nothing I did would fix this - not in the receiver or the projector. Boo.\\n\\nErgonomics:\\n\\nSo, the carry handle is adorable. I mean really, a carry handle on a projector! Also, the power cord is integrated, - 10 ft long, and retracts into the unit with a press of a button on the left side. Very cool. Interestingly, though, with the USA version I have, the power cord is not grounded. It’s just a regular two-prong. The best thing about this projector is that you just grab it and go. You’ve got your apps, and screen sharing features built in. You’ve got WiFi built in, the power cord built in etc. It’s just a complete package.\\n\\nThe question then remains: Who is this projector for? Well, that’s a tough one. I hate to say it, but it feels like this projector is more for demos and presentations than for actual movie rooms or living rooms - when using it standing up. See, it’s not a short throw (a major downer), which means the projector is likely going to be placed bang smack where people are seated, - which is a nuisance. And let’s be honest here - you’re not likely to use the projector’s built-in speakers long-term, no matter how good they are. If you’re spending this kind of money on a projector, you likely are going to have at least a sound bar or separate speakers to get the most out of your setup. So then you’re talking cabling etc. And that complicates the whole setup. And if you’re in a dedicated movie-space cave, then the contrast of this projector is plain and simply not even close to good enough.\\n\\nSo, it’s a bit of a pain in the living room, and doesn’t do a good enough job in a dedicated movie space. That leaves classrooms and business demos. Sure, it has a handle, but it also weighs about 15lbs, and has no case of any sort (not even a sleeve protect it just a little).\\n\\nI just don’t know. While this is an interesting and unique projector in this space - I feel like it’s a solution looking for a problem, in at least a few ways. Fundamentally, if this were an ultra-short throw projector, it would open up so many brilliant placement options. But since it’s not, it limits itself too much.\\n\\nAfter much deliberation, I think the best place for this projector probably still is a living room space, but ceiling mounted with cabling solutions. Then the projector isn’t on the ground in the way of your seating (or blinding your children), cabling isn’t an issue, keystone isn’t an issue, and you get the superb brightness of the laser engine. But that does sort-of defeat the purpose of a projector with a handle and mobility…, and with no lens shift it’s still going to be somewhat of a nuisance. It seems you can’t win, here… Overall, I’ve struggled with this device. I wanted to love it. I hoped it would be a brilliant living-room solution for me without the complication of ceiling mounting. But it’s not.\\n\\n3.25 stars out of 5. A great idea, but not quite there…\\nRead more',\n",

I’m hearing sounds from instruments that I’ve never heard before when playing my favorite songs. I strongly recommend this system to anyone if going with 5.1 surround. I was thinking that if I were putting a system in a much larger room, I would have bought a 7.1 receiver and tried using the Klipsch as surround speakers with the Cerwin Vegas in the front and now after listening to the Klipsch, I would go with Klipsch all the way around.',\n",
       " 'When it comes to speaker sound, audio quality is completely subjective. Speaker companies build loyalty because of the way the sound is produced. I will admit that I am a huge fan of Klipsch’s sound. I have computer speakers by Klipsch (over 15 years old now!). I have my main TV area built around Klipsch speakers. When it came time to update my video game surround sound system (I had a very old Onkyo home theater in a box), I looked to Klipsch.\\n\\nThe Reference Series is one of the best on the market. I have listened to most of them through various receivers, and they all sound amazing. However, my room with my video game system has very limited space (aka man-cave), and although I wanted those large tower speakers, I simply had no room for them.\\n\\nEnter the Reference Theater Pack, which came out in November 2017. I could not find them in a store to listen to because they were so new. I bought them on instinct and trust that if I liked all the other Reference speakers, I would like these. They are small, yet contain all the power of the Reference line.\\n\\nOne word: Amazing! I hooked them up to my brand new Denon receiver. I used AudioQuest X2 speaker wire (14 gauge) and took my time to hook up everything correctly. I booted up my Playstation 4 and played some games and movies. The sound was unlike anything I have heard before. First, the new receiver was picking up the correct Dolby format from the Playstation games and movies. Second, the sound out of each individual speaker was crystal clear. The highs, lows, and mids were all there. From a small, tiny sound in the background to a voice in the foreground, everything came alive. I was able to crank up the sound, and although it was loud, it did not hurt my ears.\\n\\nOne thing that attracted me to Klipsch all those years ago was how they incorporate bass into the rest of their sound. Sometimes, I hear systems where I can hear all the sound, and then some bass is thrown in on top. It drowns out everything else. I have never liked that style of sound creation. Instead, Klipsch’s bass is equally integrated into the rest of the sound. In other words, I know my subwoofer is on, but it never overpowers anything else. It can rattle my walls without hurting my ears.\\n\\nThese are the best 5.1 speakers I have ever heard. Their size and power are unmatched.\\n\\nIf there is one negative, it is how Klipsch designed the speaker wire plug on these speakers. You have to thread the wire through the frame of the speaker and then through the plug itself, which requires you to push and hold in order to get the wire through. If I was using a small gauge wire, this might not be hard to do. But the X2 14 gauge wire is as big as these speakers will take, and it was very hard to hook them up. I had a flashlight under my chin, a finger pushing in the plug, and a very steady hand to get those wires in. On small slip and the copper wire bunched up. I am not sure why Klipsch made this so hard to do.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend these speakers. If you have a room limited by space, and these fit your needs, you will be very happy with this purchase. They have made every single game, movie, and TV show sound better and come alive with full audio immersion.\\nRead more',\n",
       " \"I had ditched my last surround sound speakers 6-7 years ago because it was just too much for an apartment. What i was looking for was good quality sound that wouldn't have to be so loud that it would drive my neighbors crazy. It'll never match larger floor standing speakers, but those aren't practical for a lot of people. The speakers are extremely clear at reasonable volumes with is perfect for an apartment or condo when you don't want to drive your neighbors crazy. I paired them with a Pioneer 9.2 channel receiver with an eye towards expanding out more later. I'm thinking a second set could be configured to make a 5.2.4 or a 7.2.2 atmos system with the additional satellites mounted on the ceiling. Although even with just 5.1 channels i had forgotten how much better movies and TV are when the sound surrounds you\",\n",

       " \"The most important thig, the sound, is deep and full. Very resonant. It comes with color coded wires that make the installation easy. I put in 14' X 12' room and the supplied wires were plenty long enough. Definitely could fit bigger room. My frustration was in the mounting brackets. First, the wire comes out same hole as the mounting bolt, and there is a gap inside for the wire, so the bolt kept slipping into the gap instead of seating into correct hole. A small untreaded guide would have helped. Also, it is designed so that wire must come out DOWNWARD, so have to loop wire if running above. I drilled holes in the bracket cover in order to pull them out upward to avoid looping the wire. The brackets are smooth and unobtrusive, but could have been engineered much better.\",\n",

Amazon was really good about refunding my money. I reordered and received the speakers 3 days ago.\\nThe system includes a center speaker, two front speakers, two rear speakers, and a sub-woofer. I purchased an Onkyo TX-NR676 receiver to power the speakers, and I am getting a true surround-sound experience. The set up took only about 10 minutes, and I found it to be easy.\\nThe only drawback is that the satellite speakers and sub-woofer aren't wireless, so I have to find a way to run the speaker wires across the living room.\\nOverall, I'm very happy with the speakers, and would recommend them to my friends.\",\n",

I've now had to talk to them a few times it's been about two weeks. Turns out with the single return label they want the entire 5.1 system.\\nAs anyone knows this will take some doing as it's all mounted on the walls and packaging would be the size of a small coffin.

I'm not sure what the negative reviews are all about. Boohoo you have to use 2 remotes, not pyles fault because your tv doesnt support them. Set up is simple, took me less than an hour to stretch the wiring and hookup the hdmi cables. I'm not sure all the issues people have reviewed about using the ARC function, I'm using the cheapest smart tv (hisense) that money could buy 6 years ago and I am currently experiencing zero issues. The individual channel control is awesome in my opinion, allows you to set speakers to what you feel is optimal. Sure other more pricey models may have a microphone to set up the speakers but at the end of the day the microphone is a default algorithm that doesnt tune things to your personal preference. Now the only I dislike I have the the am/FM tuner, it would be nice to be able to glide through radio channels without stopping, going to make setting presets a real pain in the butt. However I got what I paid for on that end of the spectrum and I will live. The units fan is quite as a whisper, remote gives full operation. For the price, I am happy. Maybe I will upgrade later.

       " 'I purchased this unit to allow me to use my analog Bose 701 speakers to output audio from my Samsung 55-inch TV. Here is why I am returning this unit:\\n\\n1. I have a 23+ year old JVC home theater receiver that was dated but working. I sent audio from my Samsung out the digital optical to the receiver (using PCM) and then to the Bose speakers with speaker wires. I was able to get this Pyle unit to work with the TV as well. So the basic required functionality of getting audio from the TV to the Bose speakers was accomplished with both the JVC and Pyle.\\n2. I was able to get the Samsung to allow me to control the volume through my JVC with the Xfinity remote. Hence I had one remote (Xfinity) that allowed me to do everything. The same could not be said for the Pyle. There was no 5 digit code that would allow the Xfinity remote to control the Samsung volume through the Pyle.\\n3. The Pyle manual (page 8) talks about an ARC (Audio return Channel) functionality to allow audio to be controlled from a single remote. I spent over 45 minutes on the phone with technical support and they were unable to provide me with any technical information to show me how to connect the unit (with other than an optical cable) to accomplish this. In fact, they recommended using optical and left me with the impression that ARC doesn\\'t even apply to this unit.\\n4. The Pyle manual talks about the \\'Display\\' function on the remote and unit. There is NO button on the remote control for \"Display\".\\n\\nThis unit may have other benefits (such as Bluetooth) and 4K HD integration but my interest was purely to find a newer receiver unit with the potential of future 5 speaker Dolby that I can immediately use for audio to my pair of Bose analog speakers from the TV and to control it all with a single Xfinity remote. This receiver can not currently be integrated with the Xfinity Remote.\\nRead more',\n",

Haven't tested other bluetooth connections like smartphones but there are many more connectivity available via wireless.\\n\\nCon\\n\\n1. No longer a Con. You can adjust display such as contrast, brightness, etc. So disregard this section. **updated**\\n\\n2. Amazon Prime video is not available on the go. The pre-installed Internet browser (Chrome) works well but it does not support Amazon Prime video streaming. Amazon fire stick will probably allow you to watch Amazon Prime videos. I haven't tried it yet, but it should work.\\n\\n3. Remote control could get better. I got used to it in 2 days but it seemed complicated at first. Too many buttons. Also, the buttons feel a bit too dull, making the whole menu navigation experience feel less crisp. Durability looks good instead.\\n\\n4. No zoom in out or position change. I knew about this before the purchase and it didn't cause too much trouble, but I'd much prefer to have the feature.\\n\\nOkay\\n\\n1. Fan noise level is okay. When there is sound it is barely noticeable. When there is no sound, it is quite noticeable. But, it did not bother me much for 8 hour straight use even though my projector is placed right next to me. With headphones on, the fan noise is unnoticeable. You can hear the fan running on open can headphones, but only when theres no sound. Not a big problem for me.\\n\\n2. Sound quality and loudness from this tiny projector is actually not bad. It depends on what source you are playing, but with Nintendo Switch hooked on, it gets pretty loud. The projector is set right next to my bed and if I put it over 50% loudness, I lower it down to 35% to 40% in less than 10 minutes because it hurts my ears. Nothing special but clear enough sound. Left right recognition is there, too but not great. Bass is not really there and I did not expect it to be. I think overall sound quality is okay for a small projector. Definitely acceptable. However, the internal speaker won't be good for Bluray audio or other multi channel support audio media. I played a 12GB movie and the internal speaker just sounded jammed. Foggy and very unclear. I suspect it is due to the amplified bass signals the input source is sending out. Otherwise, everything else worked just fine so far.\\n\\n3. Built-in TV interface. Its alright. Pretty fast to go through menus. Click response time is very short and the operation software has never been slow or draggy for me. Menus look clean and easy to navigate. Fast enough to change through differenct sources, too. Takes only 3 seconds to change from HDMI port#1 to port#2. Have not noticed any lag at all in terms of software interface. Also, the menu orders are customizable. For instance you can put Youtube 1st, HDMI#1 2nd, HDMI#2 3rd, Netflix 4th, etc. You can change pre-set display mode with short key button on the remote control. However, as I mentioned, there are too many buttons on the remote control and the buttons feel dull, rubbery, and somewhat hard. I believe it is made this way for durability, but the fast interface feels slower due to this not so snappy feeling remote control.\\n\\nFinal thoughts **updated**\\n\\n**I could give this projector 4 stars for not having the display customization**<<NOT TRUE. You can adjust display attributes all you want>> but decided give it a 5 stars because of the flash sale (about 100 off). The preset modes aren't bad either except for the two expert mode for different room situations which I think are pretty useless. The remote control gets on my nerves but its not like they feel cheap or don't work properly. Just lack some finesse. Overall, I am really glad I bought this 1080p projector over the 720p Wowoto H9.\\n\\n**update**\\n\\nI read someone's comment and realized you can adjust Contrast, Brightness, H Sharpness, V Sharpness, Color, Tint, Color Temperature, Dynamic Contrast, Super Resolution, Color Gamut, Edge Enhancer, Color Filter, Gamma, White Balance, Color Mnagement System. Wow.\\nRead more\",\n",

My gf was watching Netflix and she said she got “connection error” messages about 5 times in the span of two hours which is rediculous because the whole reason why I bought this for $50 more over the nighthawk was because I heard it was incredibly stable but that obviously wasn’t true.\\nAnother issue I had with the eero was that I couldn’t support 1gb over WiFi. I was told that it could but was misinformed which isn’t their fault but still, you’d think a router this expensive would be able to handle more than a cheaper router but instead it barely handles half.\\nNow, the biggest gripe I have with this router is the whole single SSID roaming speed thing. It sounds good in theory where devices and services that don’t need 5 ghz get put to 2.4 and vice versa but, at least in my case, it doesn’t actually do that. I have a gaming pc that I stream from maybe 10 feet away from the router and couldn’t get above 200 mbs because the router refused to roam to 5 ghz. And what makes it even worse and that there’s no way to set the router to 5ghz which just seems dumb to me. It’s one thing if the router was super intelligent with how it roamed but it’s obviously not.\\nWith all these issues, I decided to return this and get the nighthawk which supports speeds above 1 gb/s, has more than one SSID, and costs less.\\nTLDR, don’t buy this over priced piece of junk. It doesn’t support WiFi speeds over 600 (less than half of what the $150 nighthawk does), it only has one SSID and their “roaming” system isn’t smart enough to realize that a pc which is streaming while playing video games 10 feet away needs 5ghz speeds instead of 2.4.\\nRead more',\n",

Right now, I have to walk so freaking far away from my house where the 5GHz band no longer works and eero puts my phone onto the 2.4GHz band. Very annoying.\",\n",

Tried the Google Wi-Fi router and wound up being more trouble than it was worth. Way too restrictive with the administration of the router, i.e. Google has documented issues with port forwarding. That alone became a deal breaker as I forward security cameras, doorbells, etc. ports. $100 in the trash as I can't return it because it's past the return time frame. The eero is really amazing. Coverage is great, solid admin control of the router's features, and very user-friendly. The setup/management is all app based and there is no web-based option.

But in the end, you're paying for reliability and consistent router operation. I also wanted to mention customer support. I had to contact them about the router because it did not want to update to the latest firmware. Day 1, contacted support via email. Day 2, support responded and I was asked to give some information on how I was using the router (which wires were connected to the router and what internet service provider and modem model number I was using). Day 3, customer support responds and indicates that there were documented issues with the modem model I had at home from my internet provider (Spectrum). Day 4, went to Spectrum and they replaced my old modem with a newer model. I went home and plugged everything up. Went through the router app setup again and BAM! everything worked and the modem was able to update itself to the latest firmware.

Router was excellent so I bought mine shortly thereafter in mid March 2018.\\n\\nIt installed easily, plugged it in and it worked perfectly. Setup was a breeze. My home LAN is a mix of wireless and ethernet devices-two computers, a printer, five NAS devices connected through switches, some phones and tablets. Everything connected, the ethernet ports at 1000mbps.\\n\\nFast forward seven weeks. One bright May morning I looked at the router and noticed that the LAN ports LED indicators had changed from white to amber. The ports had switched to 100mbps. Not a good thing.\\n\\nSpeed tests were surprising-the wireless part of the router was still running as fast as always at 39MBps. The ethernet ports could barely hit 6MBps.\\n\\nSo I did all the things one normally does to show love for electronics. Rebooted, power cycled, reset to factory specs, flashed new firmware, direct connected computer to the modem(to verify the modem wasn't in some way failing) and to each lan port through brand new cat 5 and cat 6 cable.

I highly recommend it!\\n\\nWe moved to the middle of nowhere about 7 years ago and it never occurred to us to check who provided TV/internet/phone at the new house before buying. We found out after buying the house that the only providers were satellite companies. We realized very quickly that first year that satellite sucks, the internet specifically. We got locked into a $75 a month plan with HughesNet for a year and never once were able to actually use the internet that whole year. It was really frustrating. We simply did not have home internet for the past 6 years due to a lack of a decent provider. This past week Spectrum finally moved their service to our road. We immediately signed up. I knew I wasn't paying them $5 a month to rent a router from them but I also wasn't sure at all how to pick out a router myself. I've always been pretty tech savvy but when you lose access(and a need) to those things you stop keeping up with them, I was seriously behind on all the new updates that have been made over the last several years. I knew I didn't want to spend more than $50 on a router and after doing some research I finally decided on this TP-Link AC1200 and basically just hoped for the best. Some of the reviews weren't great so I was nervous. It arrived a day after our internet was installed so I set it up by myself. It took me all of 20 mins from unboxing to the whole house having Wi-Fi, it was VERY easy. I love that it has it's own app, a very convenient feature. We live in a 2000sq. ft., one floor, manufactured home. These homes have pretty thin walls so the signal reaches from one end to the other very easily. We are also extremely heavy on our data usage in this family and while it's only been a couple of days now it has had zero trouble keeping up with us. We've had zero buffering while streaming & using our phones, everything has been working very quickly. We have several smart TVs, cell phones, a laptop, a printer & a PS4 connected to it at the moment. The technician from Spectrum who installed our internet also said this was a good option for our 200mbps plan. I hope this helps someone make up their mind on whether this router will be a good choice for them. I will update the review if anything changes but as of now this seems to have been a pretty solid purchase and I'm happy with it.\\nRead more\",\n",

I don't know why they did it like this but both are excellent routers and all you need unless you have some very complicated home network setup or live in a very, very large house. Also, the only real difference between the two is that the A6 is much newer and sleeker looking and it has an MU-MIMO option, which is turned off by default and that you'll probably never even notice. It's also cheaper than the older C1200 right now.\\n\\nI had the C1200 for a few years (V1) and it never gave me a single problem. The only reason I bought the A6 is that the C1200 (at least the V1 - they're on V3 now I think) had a problem with IPV6 networking with Comcast internet. If you care about that at all (and you probably don't), I've had the new A6 for several days now and the IPV6 support has been flawless, as expected.

If the A6 chipset is as great as everyone says, then it stands to reason the A7 and A9 should be even better... right? Not entirely true. Sure, I could have paid $300 for the latest and greatest technology but the A7 was actually older and had less tech than the A6. I struggled with my decision... How could a $40 router be better than a $120 router.... I ordered the $40 router with the knowledge that I could always return it and spend the extra $$ for the bigger better version. I have a background as a microsoft systems engineer and cisco certified eng. so I'm not completely stupid no matter what the wife tells you. So... this $40 router is surprisingly good..... as in REALLY GOOD! Setup involved my iPhone downloading their app, setting up an account and setting a password.

I logged onto the wifi with my iPhone, launched the app... it found the router and after a few simple questions the process was complete. The software interface is basic compared to more robust routers, but for 95% of home users it's all and maybe even more control than you'll ever truly use. We kept the old Arris and we're using it as the cable modem only...** IMPORTANT BITS HERE** turned off the wifi signals inside the old Arris modem / router for both the 2.4 ghz and the 5 ghz wifi so it wouldn't interfere with the new TP-Link router. We have strong signals throughout the house (2000 sq ft 3 level). Really impressed so far.... I'll update if I see any issues.... still skeptical of a $40 router being this good. **UPDATE** Ran multiple speed tests from different sites... all were within a few mbs of 200 mb download.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m conflicted when it comes to the D-Link AC2600 Smart MU-MIMO Dual Band Mesh Router (DIR-2640-US Black). The thing is that I know that most people don\\'t know what a router is, or what it does. They will never go into the settings of the router, beyond just changing the admin password and their wireless SSID and WPA2 settings. I\\'ll give a bit more in-depth review anyway.\\n\\nThe DIR-2640 comes in a slick retail box. Inside, you get the router, a larger than expected power brick, and a flat Ethernet cord. The router is handsome, with 4 flip-up, non-replaceable antennas. Interestingly, the unit sports purple LEDs for the indicator lights. Physical setup consists of plugging in the DC adapter (with it\\'s shockingly short power cord), and connecting an Ethernet cable from the router\\'s WAN port to your cable/DSL modem or fiber transceiver.\\n\\n\"Soft\" setup, for me, consisted of connecting to the router\\'s admin page. The router defaults to being a DHCP server, and to parking itself on 192.168.0.1. After changing the admin password of the device, I changed the base subnet and DHCP pool range. Next, I changes the SSID and WPA2 password. By default, the DIR-2640 does not allow you to set the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz SSIDs independently. Instead, the \"Smart Connect\" feature causes them to both have whatever SSID you specify. I then enabled and set up the \"Guest Zone\", which is basically a VLAN\\'d guest network. This is a great feature for all of your IoT devices, since it\\'s best to not have them on your main LAN. The last things I did were to turn off WPS (it\\'s insecure), and turn off IPv6 DHCP.\\n\\nWhile the management interface is clean and easy to use, it\\'s super obvious that the router is just REALLY BASIC in terms of its feature set. It\\'s almost like D-Link decided it was best to not offer anything more than the most basic features for fear of confusing the average home user. There\\'s port forwarding (only 24 entries), but no port triggering. There\\'s QoS, but it must be by host (no protocol or port option), and there are only 5 \"buckets\" for prioritizing devices - so weird. There\\'s some rudimentary access control, but nothing that\\'s really robust enough to be considered parental control. There\\'s a VPN, but you can\\'t automatically generate profiles for non-iOS devices. The frustrating thing is that you know that the SoC is more than capable of doing all of the \"big\" router things... D-Link just doesn\\'t let it.\\n\\nAs far as the router\\'s performance goes, it is fine. I have the DIR-2640 on a 450 Mbit/s dl/ 25 MBit/s ul connection, with about 30 connected devices. I fired up Chariot and sustained bandwidth didn\\'t suffer, even with the NAT on the device handling 3000 open connections. Not bad for a home router. There\\'s no CPU utilization indicator, so it\\'s hard to say how it would scale to a 1 Gbit/s connection, but I\\'d assume it would be ok. The wireless performance is extremely good, with a Pixel 3 XL and an iPhone 11 Pro Max both managing to transfer at 300-350 Mbit/s from 30 feet (through two walls). The 2.4Ghz range is particularly good, too. This router supports mesh networking, but I didn\\'t have a satellite AP to try with it.\\n\\nThe bottom line is this: if you want a set-and-forget home router with good wireless performance, the DIR-2640 is definitely worth a look. However, if you are the type of person that will need to actually get in and need to do anything moderately advanced (there\\'s no VLAN support, for example), then this is not for you. Conditionally recommended.\\n\\n❤️ If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below\\nRead more',\n",

After talking to tech support I returned it and got this hoping for better. And I feel like I got way way better. Sadly my phone is the only tech I have that gets the fastest wifi speed. So I used that for the speed tests. I had one night that I was getting horrible speed. But I think it was more my phone then the router. Other then that I'm getting between 150-200 speed tests. But the router is pushing out 433. The 2 pictures of the single strength is right in front of the router, and at the furthest point of the house which is also the furthest away from router. While the single strength of the wife still shows pretty good at a distance it does cut out some. And my daughters old galaxy E tablet likes to buffer some while in the same room at router.

       " \"In all honesty, this is certainly a capable router and will be a good fit for many. It will provide fantastic speeds and will be a nice upgrade for older routers not capable of keeping up with the increasing internet speeds provided today by most ISPs.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Netgear decided to dramatically change the internal components and then still sell it under the same name (R6700). With that said, Amazon has a little product alert indicating either R6700 or R6700v2. Well, they are shipping the R6700v2 which does not match some of the specifications shown on this page (in particular the CPU speed).\\n\\nI know because after receiving a router that did not match, they offered to replace it and send the first version of the router (the one with the higher clock speeds as indicated on the actual product details) and ended up receiving the same thing (another V2).\\n\\nI will say that for those interested in a router that will not be flashed with custom software or that will not use other more advanced functions a router can provide, this is no problem. For those of us that know the hardware and know what we are expecting, that is a problem.\\n\\nI have it a 3 star because any company that makes an original version with better specs and then turns around and significantly changes this without changing the model number and making minor modifications on the box (see amazon's own photos - both boxes are pictured) simply does not deserve my trust.

       " \"This review applies to the Netgear R7000P ac2300 router. No compensation-bought it out of my own pocket.\\n\\nTwo months ago I was upgrading my home network from old 100mbs to gigabit. Did a lot of research and this R7000P seemed to be the best compromise between cost and capability. My son was also upgrading his home and agreed with my assessment. He bought first. Router was excellent so I bought mine shortly thereafter in mid March 2018.\\n\\nIt installed easily, plugged it in and it worked perfectly. Setup was a breeze. My home LAN is a mix of wireless and ethernet devices-two computers, a printer, five NAS devices connected through switches, some phones and tablets. Everything connected, the ethernet ports at 1000mbps.\\n\\nFast forward seven weeks. One bright May morning I looked at the router and noticed that the LAN ports LED indicators had changed from white to amber. The ports had switched to 100mbps. Not a good thing.\\n\\nSpeed tests were surprising-the wireless part of the router was still running as fast as always at 39MBps. The ethernet ports could barely hit 6MBps.\\n\\nSo I did all the things one normally does to show love for electronics. Rebooted, power cycled, reset to factory specs, flashed new firmware, direct connected computer to the modem(to verify the modem wasn't in some way failing) and to each lan port through brand new cat 5 and cat 6 cable. I even yelled at it hoping intimidation would work. No joy. The router management software reported and speed tests confirmed that the ethernet ports were under 100mbps, not even close to 1000mbps. Phone support was less than helpful.\\n\\nIt's beyond 30 days so I can't return it to Amazon and if I spend hours navigating a support system directing me do do all the troubleshooting I have already done I might eventually be able to return it for exchange. I pay shipping both ways, wait a week or three with no network.\\n\\nAbout a week after mine went wonky my son's failed in exactly the same way. He bought his at Walmart and had no trouble returning it and getting an ASUS.\\n\\nSo, the most expensive router I have ever owned is operating in cripple mode. When I can afford it I'll buy something else. Not Netgear.\\n\\nOne thing I did learn is that the 21,500+ reviews are not necessarily for this router. There is a filter switch near the review stars that lets you see only confirmed purchasers of this specific router-and that is lots less. Turns out I'm not the Lone Ranger-others have had similar issues.\\n\\nAll of which is a very long-winded way of explaining how the R7000P managed to earn a single star.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"Sadly I had problems. Right out of the box the router was super easy to install and configure. No problems and no questions. After using it for several hours I noticed the speed was no where near what my old router provided. Comparing the speed when directly connected to the modem and then with a connection to one of the lan ports I found that the speed was less than 10% of the direct connection. I contacted Tech Support, which was very good and they had me do thorough testing (several times). I had changed the default LAN address to 192.168.1.1 from the default. When I changed back to the 192.168.0.1 default I found the speed went up significantly. 70% to 80% of the direct modem connection. Since I expect near 100%, I assumed I must have a defective router. I requested a return from Amazon and within a day I received another router. Hooked it up, did my testing and STILL only 70% - 80% of the max speed. I worked with Tech Support for 5 days with no solutions to my problem. They referred the ticket to the senior support folks but I can't wait on a solution that may never come. Luckily my old router still had WiFi functioning (but no working LAN ports) so I'm still limping along until I decide on a new router.\\n\\nI suggest new buyers do the following as soon as you plug in the router: 1) Update the firmware first thing. 2) Don't make any changes to the default LAN address (yet) 3) Do a speed test between your PC and modem and then do another from one of the LAN ports on the router. Make sure it's pretty close to the modem speed (my old router is between 96% and 99% of max) 4) If all looks good at this point make your changes to the LAN address (if needed) and check again. Hopefully all will be fine. Unfortunately my experience was not so good.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"My Netgear router from 2013 was starting to fail so I figured it was time to get a replacement so that I could avoid downtime. I paid about $170 for the Netgear back then, and, after looking at various choices I really wasn't swayed enough to spend the same amount (or more) on its replacement. So I read a bunch of reviews and critiques on non-Negear routers and thought I would take a chance on this model, the TP-Link AC1900 @ $79.95. It arrived the next day and I found it easy to set up (about 10 min). Frankly, I was blown away at the D/L speeds I was getting from this inexpensive device! With our old router, we were able to get 40-50Mps on the opposite side of our house, using several devices and I thought that was pretty good. But with this new router, the D/L speeds shot up to between 180-225 Mps on the 5Ghz band - exceptional. Unless this router craps out in some short period of time, I can recommend this to be the best $80 you could spend for a no-frill basic wireless router.\",\n",
       " 'I have typically changed ISPs every year or two when they jack up the introductory rates. Each time it is necessary to change passwords on every wireless device and set up a new router with port forwarding, DDNS, etc. The last straw was when I was recently denied access to my ISP\\'s router settings because of their \"maintenance\". So I decided to get my own router to end that nuisance and meddling. I don\\'t need more speed than required for 2-3 HD video streams, so at less than $100, the TP-Link AC1900 Archer A9 seemed attractive.\\n\\nSo in a week the router has been configured without problems for about 5 wired (with an ethernet switch) and 5 wireless devices, including two slingboxes and an industrial temperature monitoring computer requiring static routing and port forwarding with DDNS service. (TP-Link provides its own free dynamic DNS service or for use of NO-IP or DynDNS.) There is a downloadable 112 page user manual with live indexing that seems easy to use, although I\\'ve barely touched on topics like VPN and remote management. I do not even know what MIMO may be useful for yet.\\nI have confirmed that the router\\'s WPS button works for easily connecting my wireless printer; and that it also turns the wireless signal off/on if it is pressed more than momentarily.\\n\\nThe router\\'s 2.4 GB wireless signal is more than adequate for my house and yard. My Dell laptop speed tests at 20-25 mbps max up/down in most places up to 25 feet away in the house and 50 feet away in the yard when the signal is set to \"medium\" strength. At 100 feet from the house the signal dropped to about 3 down, 6 up or 12 down, 12 up depending on laptop orientation. On \"high\" strength the poor orientation values doubled. Similar low speed tests and laptop orientation effects were noted in a bathroom separated from the router by twelve feet and six one inch thick plaster wall layers. In no case would I expect problems streaming a video.\\n\\nMy hardwired computer speed tests at 200 Mbps down, 35 up, which is what my ISP provides, so I cannot comment on higher speed results.

If you reboot your modem and this device, go make coffee or something when it is starting back up because the router takes a while to restart. The light finally went green but it did feel like it took an inordinate amount of time.\\n\\nI understand the frustration that comes with setting up these new things and the rage factor sometimes enters the picture.

Give it 5-10 minutes and hopefully you'll be good to go.\\n\\nThe interface looks a bit dated and clonky but most do. Seems the least priority is given to creating a clean, attractive interface for all these things, but coming from an Airport Extreme where you have essentially no features to work with, this is a dream. The ability to edit the names of the clients is something I was never able to do before and it really makes a difference.\\n\\nI wanted something with the ability to kick clients off the network while I am using the Quest to ensure it has no bandwidth competition with devices that are not in use at the time the Quest is being used, but then put them back on without having to jump through hoops, re-entering passwords and such. I have a lot of devices on my network and while they may not be in use, they are still hovering around and eating up some bandwidth even while idling.\\n\\nThis router allows that in an easy peasy way but the icons used are confusing. First, if you go to the Network map, clients section, you will see a list of all the clients on your network. You can click the pencil next to the name of the device and change it to make life easier. On the right side, if you click Block, that client gets blacklisted and cannot connect to the network. If you click View Blacklist, you will see all of the blocked clients and there is a garbage can icon on the right. This is a confusing and poor icon choice because most people would think that this will remove the client entirely. It doesn't. It simply puts the client back on the whitelist. It's a great thing to have, for example:\\n\\nLet's say you have a Zoom meeting and want to ensure that there's as little connection issues as possible. You can block all other clients on the network that are not needed and have all the bandwidth to yourself for your meeting and when it's over, just click the garbage can on each device in the blacklist and poof! they are all able to connect again.\\n\\nI am not really understanding the point of the QoS feature on this device because in the past when I've set up QoS in a work environment, you are able to directly allocate bandwidth to devices. Ideally, this would be what you would use if you had a Zoom call rather than kicking clients off for a time. With this router's QoS, you have two choices: On or Off. Each device listed has a Priority switch that is turned on or off. You can turn on the Priority switch for one, some or all devices, but there's nothing else, so you have no idea how bandwidth allocation is implemented here.\\n\\nUnder the On/Off switch for QoS, there is a bandwidth allocation box for both upload and download with each set at 1000. You can change this number, but again, it doesn't tell you how it will divvy out that bandwidth to the clients. If you only have one device with the Priority turned on, you are left to wonder what that client is getting as opposed to other devices on the network. That's kind of a shame because you can prioritize a device for Always or for a couple of hours. Would seem the perfect set up for a Zoom meeting as you can give Priority to your device for a set amount of time and the router will release that restriction at the end of the hour or two or whatever you chose without you having to interact with the admin page at all. Unfortunately, you cannot enter times: i.e,. Priority from 10 a.m. to noon. You can choose Always, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 4 hours.\\n\\nI'm not sure what people are talking about regarding monthly fees for Parent Controls. I don't have kids, but opened it up and you can add a child's computer as a device, block certain keywords from being searched online and limit the days/times that your child can get online. I didn't see anything about fees or payment for those features.\\n\\nI have noticed more zip in my Quest 2 since setting up this router and am quite pleased with it so far. I set up a 5ghz network set to AX only for the Quest's exclusive use, a 2.4ghz Guest Network for all the Echos, Kindles, switches for lights, etc., and a 2.4ghz network for laptops, iPads, etc.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'Summary: Particularly if you want to run what I call a \"cheap mesh on the fly\" system, mating this Archer AX21 router to TP-Link\\'s RE-series Wi-Fi extenders that can support OneMesh+SmartConnect is a great way to go...just turn of QoS in the meantime (easily done with their robust Tether interface). Comments: Whenever a company puts out a lot of hardware variations along with a lot of software options, you have a testing permutation nightmare, having to test a large host of hardware with a huge number of variable implementation options. In my case, I tried to run the AX21 with the full suite of options: SmartConnect (single Wi-Fi name for both bands), OneMesh + WiFi Extenders (RE200+RE220), and QoS.

I have a lot of devices on my network and while they may not be in use, they are still hovering around and eating up some bandwidth even while idling.\\n\\nThis router allows that in an easy peasy way but the icons used are confusing. First, if you go to the Network map, clients section, you will see a list of all the clients on your network. You can click the pencil next to the name of the device and change it to make life easier. On the right side, if you click Block, that client gets blacklisted and cannot connect to the network. If you click View Blacklist, you will see all of the blocked clients and there is a garbage can icon on the right. This is a confusing and poor icon choice because most people would think that this will remove the client entirely. It doesn't. It simply puts the client back on the whitelist. It's a great thing to have, for example:\\n\\nLet's say you have a Zoom meeting and want to ensure that there's as little connection issues as possible. You can block all other clients on the network that are not needed and have all the bandwidth to yourself for your meeting and when it's over, just click the garbage can on each device in the blacklist and poof! they are all able to connect again.\\n\\nI am not really understanding the point of the QoS feature on this device because in the past when I've set up QoS in a work environment, you are able to directly allocate bandwidth to devices. Ideally, this would be what you would use if you had a Zoom call rather than kicking clients off for a time. With this router's QoS, you have two choices: On or Off. Each device listed has a Priority switch that is turned on or off. You can turn on the Priority switch for one, some or all devices, but there's nothing else, so you have no idea how bandwidth allocation is implemented here.\\n\\nUnder the On/Off switch for QoS, there is a bandwidth allocation box for both upload and download with each set at 1000. You can change this number, but again, it doesn't tell you how it will divvy out that bandwidth to the clients. If you only have one device with the Priority turned on, you are left to wonder what that client is getting as opposed to other devices on the network. That's kind of a shame because you can prioritize a device for Always or for a couple of hours. Would seem the perfect set up for a Zoom meeting as you can give Priority to your device for a set amount of time and the router will release that restriction at the end of the hour or two or whatever you chose without you having to interact with the admin page at all. Unfortunately, you cannot enter times: i.e,. Priority from 10 a.m. to noon. You can choose Always, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 4 hours.\\n\\nI'm not sure what people are talking about regarding monthly fees for Parent Controls. I don't have kids, but opened it up and you can add a child's computer as a device, block certain keywords from being searched online and limit the days/times that your child can get online. I didn't see anything about fees or payment for those features.\\n\\nI have noticed more zip in my Quest 2 since setting up this router and am quite pleased with it so far. I set up a 5ghz network set to AX only for the Quest's exclusive use, a 2.4ghz Guest Network for all the Echos, Kindles, switches for lights, etc., and a 2.4ghz network for laptops, iPads, etc.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'Summary: Particularly if you want to run what I call a \"cheap mesh on the fly\" system, mating this Archer AX21 router to TP-Link\\'s RE-series Wi-Fi extenders that can support OneMesh+SmartConnect is a great way to go...just turn of QoS in the meantime (easily done with their robust Tether interface). Comments: Whenever a company puts out a lot of hardware variations along with a lot of software options, you have a testing permutation nightmare, having to test a large host of hardware with a huge number of variable implementation options. In my case, I tried to run the AX21 with the full suite of options: SmartConnect (single Wi-Fi name for both bands), OneMesh + WiFi Extenders (RE200+RE220), and QoS. Well, with QoS turned on, the router cut my download speeds in half and then hard crashed one evening (I\\'ve only had the router for a bit over a week). Frankly, it bothers me that end users become a company\\'s testbed....but it\\'s more important that the product works...and in that regard, the AX21 is superior to my prior Archer A6 in terms of speed and WiFi coverage. I reported the QoS issue so I hope TP-Link will investigate and correct the system instability in a future firmware update.',\n",

Also if you're thinking of using the built in VPN software, don't! The OpenVPN version is ancient and uses outdated protocols. The PPTP server has an admin/admin login that gets automatically added periodically. You can delete it, but it will come back. Useless!
